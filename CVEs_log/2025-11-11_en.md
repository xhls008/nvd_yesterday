| 16 | CVE-2025-63711 | 7.1  | HIGH | A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the SourceCodester Client Database Management System 1.0 allows an attacker to cause an authenticated administrative user to perform user deletion actions without their consent. The application`s user deletion endpoint (e.g., superadmin_user_delete.php) accepts POST requests containing a user_id parameter and does not enforce request origin or anti-CSRF tokens. Because the endpoint lacks proper authentication/authorization checks and CSRF protections, a remote attacker can craft a malicious page that triggers deletion when visited by an authenticated admin, resulting in arbitrary removal of user accounts. | [1]https://github.com/floccocam-cpu/CVE-Research-2025/blob/main/CVE-2025-63711/README3.md<br>[2]https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/17514/client-database-management-system.html |

| 30 | CVE-2025-64484 | 8.5  | HIGH | OAuth2-Proxy is an open-source tool that can act as either a standalone reverse proxy or a middleware component integrated into existing reverse proxy or load balancer setups. In versions prior to 7.13.0, all deployments of OAuth2 Proxy in front of applications that normalize underscores to dashes in HTTP headers (e.g., WSGI-based frameworks such as Django, Flask, FastAPI, and PHP applications). Authenticated users can inject underscore variants of X-Forwarded-* headers that bypass the proxy’s filtering logic, potentially escalating privileges in the upstream app. OAuth2 Proxy authentication/authorization itself is not compromised. The problem has been patched with v7.13.0. By default all specified headers will now be normalized, meaning that both capitalization and the use of underscores (_) versus dashes (-) will be ignored when matching headers to be stripped. For example, both `X-Forwarded-For` and `X_Forwarded-for` will now be treated as equivalent and stripped away. For those who have a rational that requires keeping a similar looking header and not stripping it, the maintainers introduced a new configuration field for Headers managed through the AlphaConfig called `InsecureSkipHeaderNormalization`. As a workaround, ensure filtering and processing logic in upstream services don`t treat underscores and hyphens in Headers the same way. | [1]https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-4.2<br>[2]https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc822#section-3.2<br>[3]https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-vjrc-mh2v-45x6<br>[4]https://github.security.telekom.com/2020/05/smuggling-http-headers-through-reverse-proxies.html<br>[5]https://www.uptimia.com/questions/why-are-http-headers-with-underscores-dropped-by-nginx |
| 31 | CVE-2025-64501 | 7.6  | HIGH | ProsemirrorToHtml is a JSON converter which takes ProseMirror-compatible JSON and outputs HTML. In versions 0.2.0 and below, the `prosemirror_to_html` gem is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks through malicious HTML attribute values. While tag content is properly escaped, attribute values are not, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code. Applications that use `prosemirror_to_html` to convert ProseMirror documents to HTML, user-generated ProseMirror content, and end users viewing the rendered HTML output are all at risk of attack. This issue is fixed in version 0.2.1. | [1]https://github.com/etaminstudio/prosemirror_to_html/commit/4d59f94f550bcabeec30d298791bbdd883298ad8<br>[2]https://github.com/etaminstudio/prosemirror_to_html/security/advisories/GHSA-52c5-vh7f-26fx |
| 32 | CVE-2025-64508 | 7.5  | HIGH | Bugsink is a self-hosted error tracking tool. In versions prior to 2.0.5, brotli "bombs" (highly compressed brotli streams, such as many zeros) can be sent to the server. Since the server will attempt to decompress these streams before applying various maximums, this can lead to exhaustion of the available memory and thus a Denial of Service. This can be done if the `DSN` is known, which it is in many common setups (JavaScript, Mobile Apps). The issue is patched in Bugsink version `2.0.5`. The vulnerability is similar to, but distinct from, another brotli-related problem in Bugsink, GHSA-rrx3-2x4g-mq2h/CVE-2025-64509. | [1]https://github.com/bugsink/bugsink/commit/3f65544aab3ad5303d97009136640de97b0676a5<br>[2]https://github.com/bugsink/bugsink/pull/266<br>[3]https://github.com/bugsink/bugsink/security/advisories/GHSA-fc2v-vcwj-269v<br>[4]https://github.com/google/brotli/commit/67d78bc41db1a0d03f2e763497748f2f69946627<br>[5]https://github.com/google/brotli/issues/1327<br>[6]https://github.com/google/brotli/issues/1375<br>[7]https://github.com/google/brotli/pull/1234<br>[8]https://github.com/google/brotli/releases/tag/v1.2.0 |
| 33 | CVE-2025-64509 | 7.5  | HIGH | Bugsink is a self-hosted error tracking tool. In versions prior to 2.0.6, a specially crafted Brotli-compressed envelope can cause Bugsink to spend excessive CPU time in decompression, leading to denial of service. This can be done if the DSN is known, which it is in many common setups (JavaScript, Mobile Apps). The issue is patched in Bugsink 2.0.6. The vulnerability is similar to, but distinct from, another brotli-related problem in Bugsink, GHSA-fc2v-vcwj-269v/CVE-2025-64508. | [1]https://github.com/bugsink/bugsink/security/advisories/GHSA-rrx3-2x4g-mq2h |
| 34 | CVE-2025-64512 | 8.6  | HIGH | Pdfminer.six is a community maintained fork of the original PDFMiner, a tool for extracting information from PDF documents. Prior to version 20251107, pdfminer.six will execute arbitrary code from a malicious pickle file if provided with a malicious PDF file. The `CMapDB._load_data()` function in pdfminer.six uses `pickle.loads()` to deserialize pickle files. These pickle files are supposed to be part of the pdfminer.six distribution stored in the `cmap/` directory, but a malicious PDF can specify an alternative directory and filename as long as the filename ends in `.pickle.gz`. A malicious, zipped pickle file can then contain code which will automatically execute when the PDF is processed. Version 20251107 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six/commit/b808ee05dd7f0c8ea8ec34bdf394d40e63501086<br>[2]https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six/releases/tag/20251107<br>[3]https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six/security/advisories/GHSA-wf5f-4jwr-ppcp |
| 35 | CVE-2025-64518 | 7.5  | HIGH | The CycloneDX core module provides a model representation of the SBOM along with utilities to assist in creating, validating, and parsing SBOMs. Starting in version 2.1.0 and prior to version 11.0.1, the XML `Validator` used by cyclonedx-core-java was not configured securely, making the library vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection. The fix for GHSA-683x-4444-jxh8 / CVE-2024-38374 was incomplete in that it only fixed parsing of XML BOMs, but not validation. The vulnerability has been fixed in cyclonedx-core-java version 11.0.1. As a workaround, applications can reject XML documents before handing them to cyclonedx-core-java for validation. This may be an option if incoming CycloneDX BOMs are known to be in JSON format. | [1]https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#schemafactory<br>[2]https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-core-java/commit/162aa594f347b3f612fe0a45071693c3cd398ce9<br>[3]https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-core-java/commit/af0ec75c93c03f93733a070c5132554490af5314<br>[4]https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-core-java/pull/737<br>[5]https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-core-java/security/advisories/GHSA-6fhj-vr9j-g45r |
| 36 | CVE-2025-64519 | 8.8  | HIGH | TorrentPier is an open source BitTorrent Public/Private tracker engine, written in php. In versions up to and including 2.8.8, an authenticated SQL injection vulnerability exists in the moderator control panel (`modcp.php`). Users with moderator permissions can exploit this vulnerability by supplying a malicious `topic_id` (`t`) parameter. This allows an authenticated moderator to execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to the potential disclosure, modification, or deletion of any data in the database. Although it requires moderator privileges, it is still severe. A malicious or compromised moderator account can leverage this vulnerability to read, modify, or delete data. A patch is available at commit 6a0f6499d89fa5d6e2afa8ee53802a1ad11ece80. | [1]https://github.com/torrentpier/torrentpier/commit/6a0f6499d89fa5d6e2afa8ee53802a1ad11ece80<br>[2]https://github.com/torrentpier/torrentpier/security/advisories/GHSA-4rwr-8c3m-55f6 |
