| 46 | CVE-2024-45293 | 7.5  | HIGH | PHPSpreadsheet is a pure PHP library for reading and writing spreadsheet files. The security scanner responsible for preventing XXE attacks in the XLSX reader can be bypassed by slightly modifying the XML structure, utilizing white-spaces. On servers that allow users to upload their own Excel (XLSX) sheets, Server files and sensitive information can be disclosed by providing a crafted sheet. The security scan function in src/PhpSpreadsheet/Reader/Security/XmlScanner.php contains a flawed XML encoding check to retrieve the input file`s XML encoding in the toUtf8 function. The function searches for the XML encoding through a defined regex which looks for `encoding="*"` and/or `encoding=`*``, if not found, it defaults to the UTF-8 encoding which bypasses the conversion logic. This logic can be used to pass a UTF-7 encoded XXE payload, by utilizing a whitespace before or after the = in the attribute definition. Sensitive information disclosure through the XXE on sites that allow users to upload their own excel spreadsheets, and parse them using PHPSpreadsheet`s Excel parser. This issue has been addressed in release versions 1.29.1, 2.1.1, and 2.3.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/security/advisories/GHSA-6hwr-6v2f-3m88 |
| 47 | CVE-2024-43362 | 7.3  | HIGH | Cacti is an open source performance and fault management framework. The `fileurl` parameter is not properly sanitized when saving external links in `links.php` . Morever, the said fileurl is placed in some html code which is passed to the `print` function in `link.php` and `index.php`, finally leading to stored XSS. Users with the privilege to create external links can manipulate the `fileurl` parameter in the http post request while creating external links to perform stored XSS attacks. The vulnerability known as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) occurs when an application allows untrusted user input to be displayed on a web page without proper validation or escaping. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.2.28. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. | [1]https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-wh9c-v56x-v77c |
| 48 | CVE-2024-43363 | 7.2  | HIGH | Cacti is an open source performance and fault management framework. An admin user can create a device with a malicious hostname containing php code and repeat the installation process (completing only step 5 of the installation process is enough, no need to complete the steps before or after it) to use a php file as the cacti log file. After having the malicious hostname end up in the logs (log poisoning), one can simply go to the log file url to execute commands to achieve RCE. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.28 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-gxq4-mv8h-6qj4 |

| 51 | CVE-2024-45060 | 7.1  | HIGH | PHPSpreadsheet is a pure PHP library for reading and writing spreadsheet files. One of the sample scripts in PhpSpreadsheet is susceptible to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper handling of input where a number is expected leading to formula injection. The code in in `45_Quadratic_equation_solver.php` concatenates the user supplied parameters directly into spreadsheet formulas. This allows an attacker to take control over the formula and output unsanitized data into the page, resulting in JavaScript execution. This issue has been addressed in release versions 1.29.2, 2.1.1, and 2.3.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/blob/d50b8b5de7e30439fb57eae7df9ea90e79fa0f2d/samples/Basic/45_Quadratic_equation_solver.php#L56<br>[2]https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/security/advisories/GHSA-v66g-p9x6-v98p |
| 52 | CVE-2024-45290 | 7.7  | HIGH | PHPSpreadsheet is a pure PHP library for reading and writing spreadsheet files. It`s possible for an attacker to construct an XLSX file which links media from external URLs. When opening the XLSX file, PhpSpreadsheet retrieves the image size and type by reading the file contents, if the provided path is a URL. By using specially crafted `php://filter` URLs an attacker can leak the contents of any file or URL. Note that this vulnerability is different from GHSA-w9xv-qf98-ccq4, and resides in a different component. An attacker can access any file on the server, or leak information form arbitrary URLs, potentially exposing sensitive information such as AWS IAM credentials. This issue has been addressed in release versions 1.29.2, 2.1.1, and 2.3.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/security/advisories/GHSA-5gpr-w2p5-6m37<br>[2]https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/security/advisories/GHSA-w9xv-qf98-ccq4 |
| 53 | CVE-2024-47610 | 7.3  | HIGH | InvenTree is an Open Source Inventory Management System. In affected versions of InvenTree it is possible for a registered user to store javascript in markdown notes fields, which are then displayed to other logged in users who visit the same page and executed. The vulnerability has been addressed as follows: 1. HTML sanitization has been enabled in the front-end markdown rendering library - `easymde`. 2. Stored markdown is also validated on the backend, to ensure that malicious markdown is not stored in the database. These changes are available in release versions 0.16.5 and later. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no workarounds, an update is required to get the new validation functions. | [1]https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/commit/6e37f0cd8ba5fc527412f18f66cd6a37015fa690<br>[2]https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree/security/advisories/GHSA-wp3m-jhgv-rhqr |
| 54 | CVE-2024-47782 | 7.6  | HIGH | WikiDiscover is an extension designed for use with a CreateWiki managed farm to display wikis. Special:WikiDiscover is a special page that lists all wikis on the wiki farm. However, the special page does not make any effort to escape the wiki name or description. Therefore, if a wiki sets its name and/or description to an XSS payload, the XSS will execute whenever the wiki is shown on Special:WikiDiscover. This issue has been patched with commit `2ce846dd93` and all users are advised to apply that patch. User unable to upgrade should block access to `Special:WikiDiscover`. | [1]https://github.com/miraheze/WikiDiscover/commit/2ce846dd93ddb9ec86f7472c4d57fe71a09dc827<br>[2]https://github.com/miraheze/WikiDiscover/security/advisories/GHSA-wf48-rqx3-39mf<br>[3]https://issue-tracker.miraheze.org/T12697 |
