| 1 | CVE-2024-4442 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | The Salon booking system plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion in all versions up to, and including, 9.8. This is due to the plugin not properly validating the path of an uploaded file prior to deleting it. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files, including the wp-config.php file, which can make site takeover and remote code execution possible. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/salon-booking-system/tags/9.8/src/SLN/Action/Ajax/RemoveUploadedFile.php#L5<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3088196/salon-booking-system#file14<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/eaafeadd-f44c-49b1-b900-ef40800c629e?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2024-4566 | 7.1  | HIGH | The ShopLentor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the ajax_dismiss function in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to set arbitrary WordPress options to "true". NOTE: This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers with subscriber- or customer-level access and above if (1) the WooCommerce plugin is deactivated or (2) access to the default WordPress admin dashboard is explicitly enabled for authenticated users. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woolentor-addons/trunk/includes/admin/include/class.notice.php#L52<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3088881/woolentor-addons/trunk/includes/admin/include/class.notice.php<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c6aaabe9-4f55-4c01-b350-573e6a944353?source=cve |

| 5 | CVE-2023-3941 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | Relative Path Traversal vulnerability in ZkTeco-based OEM devices allows an attacker to write any file on the system with root privileges.This issue affects ZkTeco-based OEM devices (ZkTeco ProFace X, Smartec ST-FR043, Smartec ST-FR041ME and possibly others) with the ZAM170-NF-1.8.25-7354-Ver1.0.0 and possibly others. | [1]https://github.com/klsecservices/Advisories/blob/master/K-ZkTeco-2023-003.md |
| 6 | CVE-2023-3942 | 7.5  | HIGH | An `SQL Injection` vulnerability, due to improper neutralization of special elements used in SQL commands, exists in ZKTeco-based OEM devices. This vulnerability allows an attacker to, in some cases, impersonate another user or perform unauthorized actions. In other instances, it enables the attacker to access user data and system parameters from the database.This issue affects ZkTeco-based OEM devices (ZkTeco ProFace X, Smartec ST-FR043, Smartec ST-FR041ME and possibly others) with firmware ZAM170-NF-1.8.25-7354-Ver1.0.0 and possibly other, Standalone service v. 2.1.6-20200907 and possibly others. | [1]https://github.com/klsecservices/Advisories/blob/master/K-ZkTeco-2023-005.md |
| 7 | CVE-2023-3943 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in ZkTeco-based OEM devices allows, in some cases, the execution of arbitrary code. Due to the lack of protection mechanisms such as stack canaries and PIE, it is possible to successfully execute code even under restrictive conditions.This issue affects ZkTeco-based OEM devices (ZkTeco ProFace X, Smartec ST-FR043, Smartec ST-FR041ME and possibly others) with firmware ZAM170-NF-1.8.25-7354-Ver1.0.0 and possibly others. | [1]https://github.com/klsecservices/Advisories/blob/master/K-ZkTeco-2023-006.md |

| 10 | CVE-2024-22273 | 8.1  | HIGH | The storage controllers on VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion have out-of-bounds read/write vulnerability. A malicious actor with access to a virtual machine with storage controllers enabled may exploit this issue to create a denial of service condition or execute code on the hypervisor from a virtual machine in conjunction with other issues. | [1]https://support.broadcom.com/web/ecx/support-content-notification/-/external/content/SecurityAdvisories/0/24308 |
| 11 | CVE-2024-22274 | 7.2  | HIGH | The vCenter Server contains an authenticated remote code execution vulnerability. A malicious actor with administrative privileges on the vCenter appliance shell may exploit this issue to run arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. | [1]https://support.broadcom.com/web/ecx/support-content-notification/-/external/content/SecurityAdvisories/0/24308 |
| 12 | CVE-2024-25724 | 7.3  | HIGH | In RTI Connext Professional 5.3.1 through 6.1.0 before 6.1.1, a buffer overflow in XML parsing from Routing Service, Recording Service, Queuing Service, and Cloud Discovery Service allows attackers to execute code with the affected service`s privileges, compromise the service`s integrity, leak sensitive information, or crash the service. These attacks could be done via a remote malicious RTPS message; a compromised call with malicious parameters to the RTI_RoutingService_new, rti::recording::Service, RTI_QueuingService_new, or RTI_CDS_Service_new public APIs; or a compromised local file system containing a malicious XML file. | [1]https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/current/doc/vulnerabilities/index.html#cve-2024-25724 |
| 13 | CVE-2024-31989 | 9.0  | CRITICAL | Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It has been discovered that an unprivileged pod in a different namespace on the same cluster could connect to the Redis server on port 6379. Despite having installed the latest version of the VPC CNI plugin on the EKS cluster, it requires manual enablement through configuration to enforce network policies. This raises concerns that many clients might unknowingly have open access to their Redis servers. This vulnerability could lead to Privilege Escalation to the level of cluster controller, or to information leakage, affecting anyone who does not have strict access controls on their Redis instance. This issue has been patched in version(s) 2.8.19, 2.9.15 and 2.10.10. | [1]https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/2de0ceade243039c120c28374016c04ff9590d1d<br>[2]https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/35a7d6c7fa1534aceba763d6a68697f36c12e678<br>[3]https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/4e2fe302c3352a0012ecbe7f03476b0e07f7fc6c<br>[4]https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/53570cbd143bced49d4376d6e31bd9c7bd2659ff<br>[5]https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/6ef7b62a0f67e74b4aac2aee31c98ae49dd95d12<br>[6]https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/9552034a80070a93a161bfa330359585f3b85f07<br>[7]https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/bdd889d43969ba738ddd15e1f674d27964048994<br>[8]https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/f1a449e83ee73f8f14d441563b6a31b504f8d8b0<br>[9]https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-9766-5277-j5hr |
| 14 | CVE-2024-35220 | 7.4  | HIGH | @fastify/session is a session plugin for fastify. Requires the @fastify/cookie plugin.
