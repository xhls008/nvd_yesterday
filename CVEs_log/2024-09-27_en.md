|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2024-8404 | 7.8  | HIGH | An arbitrary file deletion vulnerability exists in PaperCut NG/MF, specifically affecting Windows servers with Web Print enabled. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must first obtain local login access to the Windows Server hosting PaperCut NG/MF and be capable of executing low-privilege code directly on the server via the web-print-hot-folder. Important: In most installations, this risk is mitigated by the default Windows Server configuration, which restricts local login access to Administrators only. However, this vulnerability could pose a risk to customers who allow non-administrative users to log into the local console of the Windows environment hosting the PaperCut NG/MF application server.Note: This CVE has been split from CVE-2024-3037. | [1]https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/Security-Bulletin-May-2024/ |

| 26 | CVE-2024-47179 | 8.8  | HIGH | RSSHub is an RSS network. Prior to commit 64e00e7, RSSHub`s `docker-test-cont.yml` workflow is vulnerable to Artifact Poisoning, which could have lead to a full repository takeover. Downstream users of RSSHub are not vulnerable to this issue, and commit 64e00e7 fixed the underlying issue and made the repository no longer vulnerable. The `docker-test-cont.yml` workflow gets triggered when the `PR - Docker build test` workflow completes successfully. It then collects some information about the Pull Request that triggered the triggering workflow and set some labels depending on the PR body and sender. If the PR also contains a `routes` markdown block, it will set the `TEST_CONTINUE` environment variable to `true`. The workflow then downloads and extracts an artifact uploaded by the triggering workflow which is expected to contain a single `rsshub.tar.zst` file. However, prior to commit 64e00e7, it did not validate and the contents were extracted in the root of the workspace overriding any existing files. Since the contents of the artifact were not validated, it is possible for a malicious actor to send a Pull Request which uploads, not just the `rsshub.tar.zst` compressed docker image, but also a malicious `package.json` file with a script to run arbitrary code in the context of the privileged workflow. As of commit 64e00e7, this scenario has been addressed and the RSSHub repository is no longer vulnerable. | [1]https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/javascript/js-actions-command-injection<br>[2]https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/actions/runs/10141104413/job/28037643579#step:1:17<br>[3]https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/blob/e08733f94c81440d19ee6a5fd5e915e9a65395f5/.github/workflows/docker-test-cont.yml<br>[4]https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/commit/64e00e743aba2a239508fea97825994e3d687ecc<br>[5]https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/security/advisories/GHSA-9mqc-fm24-h8cw<br>[6]https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests<br>[7]https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input |
| 27 | CVE-2024-47180 | 8.8  | HIGH | Shields.io is a service for concise, consistent, and legible badges in SVG and raster format. Shields.io and users self-hosting their own instance of shields using version < `server-2024-09-25` are vulnerable to a remote execution vulnerability via the JSONPath library used by the Dynamic JSON/Toml/Yaml badges. This vulnerability would allow any user with access to make a request to a URL on the instance to the ability to execute code by crafting a malicious JSONPath expression. All users who self-host an instance are vulnerable. This problem was fixed in server-2024-09-25. Those who follow the tagged releases should update to `server-2024-09-25` or later. Those who follow the rolling tag on DockerHub, `docker pull shieldsio/shields:next` to update to the latest version. As a workaround, blocking access to the endpoints `/badge/dynamic/json`, `/badge/dynamic/toml`, and `/badge/dynamic/yaml` (e.g: via a firewall or reverse proxy in front of your instance) would prevent the exploitable endpoints from being accessed. | [1]https://github.com/badges/shields/commit/ec1b6c8daccda075403c1688ac02603f7aaa50b2<br>[2]https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/10553<br>[3]https://github.com/badges/shields/pull/10551<br>[4]https://github.com/badges/shields/security/advisories/GHSA-rxvx-x284-4445 |

| 29 | CVE-2024-47076 | 8.6  | HIGH | CUPS is a standards-based, open-source printing system, and `libcupsfilters` contains the code of the filters of the former `cups-filters` package as library functions to be used for the data format conversion tasks needed in Printer Applications. The `cfGetPrinterAttributes5` function in `libcupsfilters` does not sanitize IPP attributes returned from an IPP server. When these IPP attributes are used, for instance, to generate a PPD file, this can lead to attacker controlled data to be provided to the rest of the CUPS system. | [1]https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-browsed/security/advisories/GHSA-rj88-6mr5-rcw8<br>[2]https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-filters/security/advisories/GHSA-p9rh-jxmq-gq47<br>[3]https://github.com/OpenPrinting/libcupsfilters/security/advisories/GHSA-w63j-6g73-wmg5<br>[4]https://github.com/OpenPrinting/libppd/security/advisories/GHSA-7xfx-47qg-grp6<br>[5]https://www.cups.org<br>[6]https://www.evilsocket.net/2024/09/26/Attacking-UNIX-systems-via-CUPS-Part-I |
| 30 | CVE-2024-47175 | 8.6  | HIGH | CUPS is a standards-based, open-source printing system, and `libppd` can be used for legacy PPD file support. The `libppd` function `ppdCreatePPDFromIPP2` does not sanitize IPP attributes when creating the PPD buffer. When used in combination with other functions such as `cfGetPrinterAttributes5`, can result in user controlled input and ultimately code execution via Foomatic. This vulnerability can be part of an exploit chain leading to remote code execution (RCE), as described in CVE-2024-47176. | [1]https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-browsed/security/advisories/GHSA-rj88-6mr5-rcw8<br>[2]https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-filters/security/advisories/GHSA-p9rh-jxmq-gq47<br>[3]https://github.com/OpenPrinting/libcupsfilters/security/advisories/GHSA-w63j-6g73-wmg5<br>[4]https://github.com/OpenPrinting/libppd/security/advisories/GHSA-7xfx-47qg-grp6<br>[5]https://www.cups.org<br>[6]https://www.evilsocket.net/2024/09/26/Attacking-UNIX-systems-via-CUPS-Part-I |
| 31 | CVE-2024-47176 | 8.3  | HIGH | CUPS is a standards-based, open-source printing system, and `cups-browsed` contains network printing functionality including, but not limited to, auto-discovering print services and shared printers. `cups-browsed` binds to `INADDR_ANY:631`, causing it to trust any packet from any source, and can cause the `Get-Printer-Attributes` IPP request to an attacker controlled URL.Due to the service binding to `*:631 ( INADDR_ANY )`, multiple bugs in `cups-browsed` can be exploited in sequence to introduce a malicious printer to the system. This chain of exploits ultimately enables an attacker to execute arbitrary commands remotely on the target machine without authentication when a print job is started. This poses a significant security risk over the network. Notably, this vulnerability is particularly concerning as it can be exploited from the public internet, potentially exposing a vast number of systems to remote attacks if their CUPS services are enabled. | [1]https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-browsed/blob/master/daemon/cups-browsed.c#L13992<br>[2]https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-browsed/security/advisories/GHSA-rj88-6mr5-rcw8<br>[3]https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-filters/security/advisories/GHSA-p9rh-jxmq-gq47<br>[4]https://github.com/OpenPrinting/libcupsfilters/security/advisories/GHSA-w63j-6g73-wmg5<br>[5]https://github.com/OpenPrinting/libppd/security/advisories/GHSA-7xfx-47qg-grp6<br>[6]https://www.cups.org<br>[7]https://www.evilsocket.net/2024/09/26/Attacking-UNIX-systems-via-CUPS-Part-I |
