| 2 | CVE-2025-0810 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Read More & Accordion plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the addNewButtons() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary PHP files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/expand-maker/trunk/classes/ReadMoreInit.php#L122<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/expand-maker/trunk/classes/ReadMorePages.php#L59<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/expand-maker/trunk/classes/ReadMorePages.php#L82<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/a963cd9b-9f8f-4bd2-92cd-74c5e85e1d96?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2025-2933 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Email Notifications for Updates plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the awun_import_settings() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3265589%40wp-update-mail-notification&new=3265589%40wp-update-mail-notification<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d52e644b-a58f-4e09-9e53-e9cbef75e34f?source=cve |

| 5 | CVE-2024-13776 | 8.1  | HIGH | The ZoomSounds - WordPress Wave Audio Player with Playlist plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to a denial of service due to a missing capability check on the `dzsap_delete_notice` AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 6.91. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update option values to `seen` on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update an option that would create an error on the site and deny service to legitimate users or be used to set some values to true such as registration. There are several other functions also vulnerable to missing authorization. | [1]https://codecanyon.net/item/zoomsounds-wordpress-wave-audio-player-with-playlist/6181433<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0c8e538b-7157-42d3-abee-8259c6715cd5?source=cve |
