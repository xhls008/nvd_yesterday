| 11 | CVE-2025-62518 | 8.1  | HIGH | astral-tokio-tar is a tar archive reading/writing library for async Rust. Versions of astral-tokio-tar prior to 0.5.6 contain a boundary parsing vulnerability that allows attackers to smuggle additional archive entries by exploiting inconsistent PAX/ustar header handling. When processing archives with PAX-extended headers containing size overrides, the parser incorrectly advances stream position based on ustar header size (often zero) instead of the PAX-specified size, causing it to interpret file content as legitimate tar headers. This issue has been patched in version 0.5.6. There are no workarounds. | [1]https://edera.dev/stories/tarmageddon<br>[2]https://github.com/astral-sh/tokio-tar/commit/22b3f884adb7a2adf1d3a8d03469533f5cbc8318<br>[3]https://github.com/astral-sh/tokio-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-j5gw-2vrg-8fgx<br>[4]https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/security/advisories/GHSA-w476-p2h3-79g9<br>[5]https://github.com/edera-dev/cve-tarmageddon |
