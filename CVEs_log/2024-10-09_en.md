| 1 | CVE-2024-37179 | 7.7  | HIGH | SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence Platform allows an authenticated user to send a specially crafted request to the Web Intelligence Reporting Server to download any file from the machine hosting the service, causing high impact on confidentiality of the application. | [1]https://me.sap.com/notes/3478615<br>[2]https://url.sap/sapsecuritypatchday |
| 2 | CVE-2024-8926 | 8.1  | HIGH | In PHP versions 8.1.* before 8.1.30, 8.2.* before 8.2.24, 8.3.* before 8.3.12, when using a certain non-standard configurations of Windows codepages, the fixes for  CVE-2024-4577 https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vxpp-6299-mxw3  may still be bypassed and the same command injection related to Windows "Best Fit" codepage behavior can be achieved. This may allow a malicious user to pass options to PHP binary being run, and thus reveal the source code of scripts, run arbitrary PHP code on the server, etc. | [1]https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vxpp-6299-mxw3 |
| 3 | CVE-2024-8927 | 7.5  | HIGH | In PHP versions 8.1.* before 8.1.30, 8.2.* before 8.2.24, 8.3.* before 8.3.12, HTTP_REDIRECT_STATUS variable is used to check whether or not CGI binary is being run by the HTTP server. However, in certain scenarios, the content of this variable can be controlled by the request submitter via HTTP headers, which can lead to cgi.force_redirect option not being correctly applied. In certain configurations this may lead to arbitrary file inclusion in PHP. | [1]https://github.com/php/php-src/security/advisories/GHSA-94p6-54jq-9mwp |

| 25 | CVE-2024-8911 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The LatePoint plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary User Password Change via SQL Injection in versions up to, and including, 5.0.11. This is due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts. Note that changing a WordPress user`s password is only possible if the "Use WordPress users as customers" setting is enabled, which is disabled by default. Without this setting enabled, only the passwords of plugin customers, which are stored and managed in a separate database table, can be modified. | [1]https://wpdocs.latepoint.com/changelog/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/5c9a23a3-5eb5-4f5b-bf32-c9d163426f29?source=cve |
| 26 | CVE-2024-8943 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The LatePoint plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including,  5.0.12. This is due to insufficient verification on the user being supplied during the booking customer step. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the user id. Note that logging in as a WordPress user is only possible if the "Use WordPress users as customers" setting is enabled, which is disabled by default. The vulnerability is partially patched in version 5.0.12 and fully patched in version 5.0.13. | [1]https://wpdocs.latepoint.com/changelog/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/bac8c35b-2afa-4347-b86e-2f16db19a4d3?source=cve |
