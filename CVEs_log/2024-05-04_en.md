| 4 | CVE-2024-4439 | 7.2  | HIGH | WordPress Core is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via user display names in the Avatar block in various versions up to 6.5.2 due to insufficient output escaping on the display name. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. In addition, it also makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that have the comment block present and display the comment author`s avatar. | [1]https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/57951/branches/6.4/src/wp-includes/blocks/avatar.php<br>[2]https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=57950%40%2F&new=57950%40%2F&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=#file3<br>[3]https://wordpress.org/news/2024/04/wordpress-6-5-2-maintenance-and-security-release/<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2024/04/unauthenticated-stored-cross-site-scripting-vulnerability-patched-in-wordpress-core/<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e363c09a-4381-4b3a-951c-9a0ff5669016?source=cve |

| 10 | CVE-2024-32986 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | PWAsForFirefox is a tool to install, manage and use Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) in Mozilla Firefox. Due to improper sanitization of web app properties (such as name, description, shortcuts), web apps were able to inject additional lines into XDG Desktop Entries (on Linux) and `AppInfo.ini` (on PortableApps.com). This allowed malicious web apps to introduce keys like `Exec`, which could run arbitrary code when the affected web app was launched. This vulnerability affects all Linux and PortableApps.com users of all PWAsForFirefox versions up to (excluding) 2.12.0. Windows and macOS users are not affected. This vulnerability has been fixed in commit `9932d4b` which has been included in release in v2.12.0. The main fix is implemented in the native part, but the extension also contains additional fixes. All Linux and PortableApps.com users are advised to update to this version as soon as possible. It is also recommended for Windows and macOS users to update to this version, as it contains additional fixes related to properties sanitization. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/filips123/PWAsForFirefox/commit/9932d4b289631d447f88ace09a2fabafe4cd5bd5<br>[2]https://github.com/filips123/PWAsForFirefox/releases/tag/v2.12.0<br>[3]https://github.com/filips123/PWAsForFirefox/security/advisories/GHSA-jmhv-m7v5-g5jq |
| 11 | CVE-2024-34072 | 7.8  | HIGH | sagemaker-python-sdk is a library for training and deploying machine learning models on Amazon SageMaker. The sagemaker.base_deserializers.NumpyDeserializer module before v2.218.0 allows potentially unsafe deserialization when untrusted data is passed as pickled object arrays. This consequently may allow an unprivileged third party to cause remote code execution, denial of service, affecting both confidentiality and integrity. Users are advised to upgrade to version 2.218.0. Users unable to upgrade should not pass pickled numpy object arrays which originated from an untrusted source, or that could have been tampered with. Only pass pickled numpy object arrays from trusted sources. | [1]https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/pull/4557<br>[2]https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-wjvx-jhpj-r54r |
| 12 | CVE-2024-34073 | 7.8  | HIGH | sagemaker-python-sdk is a library for training and deploying machine learning models on Amazon SageMaker. In affected versions the capture_dependencies function in `sagemaker.serve.save_retrive.version_1_0_0.save.utils` module allows for potentially unsafe Operating System (OS) Command Injection if inappropriate command is passed as the “requirements_path” parameter. This consequently may allow an unprivileged third party to cause remote code execution, denial of service, affecting both confidentiality and integrity. This issue has been addressed in version 2.214.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not override the “requirements_path” parameter of capture_dependencies function in `sagemaker.serve.save_retrive.version_1_0_0.save.utils`, and instead use the default value. | [1]https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/commit/2d873d53f708ea570fc2e2a6974f8c3097fe9df5<br>[2]https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/pull/4556<br>[3]https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-7pc3-pr3q-58vg |
| 13 | CVE-2024-4461 | 7.8  | HIGH | Unquoted path or search item vulnerability in SugarSync versions prior to 4.1.3 for Windows.

| 17 | CVE-2024-34066 | 8.4  | HIGH | Pterodactyl wings is the server control plane for Pterodactyl Panel. If the Wings token is leaked either by viewing the node configuration or posting it accidentally somewhere, an attacker can use it to gain arbitrary file write and read access on the node the token is associated to. This issue has been addressed in version 1.11.12 and users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may enable the `ignore_panel_config_updates` option as a workaround. | [1]https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/commit/5415f8ae07f533623bd8169836dd7e0b933964de<br>[2]https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/security/advisories/GHSA-gqmf-jqgv-v8fw |
