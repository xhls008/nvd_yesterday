| 11 | CVE-2024-27134 | 7.0  | HIGH | Excessive directory permissions in MLflow leads to local privilege escalation when using spark_udf. This behavior can be exploited by a local attacker to gain elevated permissions by using a ToCToU attack. The issue is only relevant when the spark_udf() MLflow API is called. | [1]https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/10874 |
| 12 | CVE-2024-45756 | 7.2  | HIGH | An issue was discovered in Centreon centreon-open-tickets 24.10.x before 24.10.0, 24.04.x before 24.04.2, 23.10.x before 23.10.1, 23.04.x before 23.04.3, and 22.10.x before 22.10.2. SQL injection can occur in the form to create a ticket. Exploitation is only accessible to authenticated users with high-privileged access. | [1]https://github.com/centreon/centreon/release<br>[2]https://thewatch.centreon.com/latest-security-bulletins-64/cve-2024-45756-centreon-open-tickets-high-severity-4064 |
| 13 | CVE-2024-7915 | 7.8  | HIGH | The application Sensei Mac Cleaner contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability, allowing an attacker to perform multiple operations as the root user. These operations include arbitrary file deletion and writing, loading and unloading daemons, manipulating file permissions, and loading extensions, among other actions.The vulnerable module org.cindori.SenseiHelper can be contacted via XPC. While the module performs client validation, it relies on the client`s PID obtained through the public processIdentifier property of the NSXPCConnection class. This approach makes the module susceptible to a PID Reuse Attack, enabling an attacker to impersonate a legitimate client and send crafted XPC messages to invoke arbitrary methods exposed by the HelperProtocol interface. | [1]https://pentraze.com/vulnerability-reports |
| 14 | CVE-2024-8272 | 7.8  | HIGH | The com.uaudio.bsd.helper service, responsible for handling privileged operations, fails to implement critical client validation during XPC inter-process communication (IPC). Specifically, the service does not verify the code requirements, entitlements, or security flags of any client attempting to establish a connection. This lack of proper validation allows unauthorized clients to exploit the service`s methods and escalate privileges to root. | [1]https://pentraze.com/vulnerability-reports |
| 15 | CVE-2024-52811 | 8.2  | HIGH | The ngtcp2 project is an effort to implement IETF QUIC protocol in C. In affected versions acks are not validated before being written to the qlog leading to a buffer overflow. In `ngtcp2_conn::conn_recv_pkt` for an ACK, there was new logic that got added to skip `conn_recv_ack` if an ack has already been processed in the payload. However, this causes us to also skip `ngtcp2_pkt_validate_ack`. The ack which was skipped still got written to qlog. The bug occurs in `ngtcp2_qlog::write_ack_frame`. It is now possible to reach this code with an invalid ack, suppose `largest_ack=0` and `first_ack_range=15`. Subtracting `largest_ack - first_ack_range` will lead to an integer underflow which is 20 chars long. However, the ngtcp2 qlog code assumes the number written is a signed integer and only accounts for 19 characters of overhead (see `NGTCP2_QLOG_ACK_FRAME_RANGE_OVERHEAD`). Therefore, we overwrite the buffer causing a heap overflow. This is high priority and could potentially impact many users if they enable qlog. qlog is disabled by default. Due to its overhead, it is most likely used for debugging purpose, but the actual use is unknown. ngtcp2 v1.9.1 fixes the bug and users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not turn on qlog. | [1]https://github.com/ngtcp2/ngtcp2/commit/44b662bd139c23fee1703bf256c13349e2e624a1<br>[2]https://github.com/ngtcp2/ngtcp2/commit/e550c1a414318d0f3f01fca1a621ae0b0428ca15<br>[3]https://github.com/ngtcp2/ngtcp2/security/advisories/GHSA-4gmv-gf46-r4g5 |
| 16 | CVE-2024-53268 | 7.2  | HIGH | Joplin is an open source, privacy-focused note taking app with sync capabilities for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS. In affected versions attackers are able to abuse the fact that openExternal is used without any filtering of URI schemes to obtain remote code execution in Windows environments. This issue has been addressed in version 3.0.3 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/security/advisories/GHSA-pc5v-xp44-5mgv |
