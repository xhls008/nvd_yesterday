| 83 | CVE-2025-31496 | 7.5  | HIGH | apollo-compiler is a query-based compiler for the GraphQL query language. Prior to 1.27.0, a vulnerability in Apollo Compiler allowed queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments to be prohibitively expensive to validate. Named fragments were being processed once per fragment spread in some cases during query validation, leading to exponential resource usage when deeply nested and reused fragments were involved. This could lead to excessive resource consumption and denial of service in applications. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.27.0. | [1]https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs/pull/952<br>[2]https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-7mpv-9xg6-5r79 |

Prior to 2.10.1, a vulnerability in Apollo Gateway allowed queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments to be prohibitively expensive to query plan, specifically during named fragment expansion. Named fragments were being expanded once per fragment spread during query planning, leading to exponential resource usage when deeply nested and reused fragments were involved. This could lead to excessive resource consumption and denial of service.

| 85 | CVE-2025-32031 | 7.5  | HIGH | Apollo Gateway provides utilities for combining multiple GraphQL microservices into a single GraphQL endpoint. Prior to 2.10.1, a vulnerability in Apollo Gateway allowed queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments to be prohibitively expensive to query plan, specifically due to internal optimizations being frequently bypassed. The query planner includes an optimization that significantly speeds up planning for applicable GraphQL selections. However, queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments can generate many selections where this optimization does not apply, leading to significantly longer planning times. Because the query planner does not enforce a timeout, a small number of such queries can render gateway inoperable. This could lead to excessive resource consumption and denial of service. This has been remediated in @apollo/gateway version 2.10.1. | [1]https://github.com/apollographql/federation/pull/3236<br>[2]https://github.com/apollographql/federation/releases/tag/%40apollo%2Fgateway%402.10.1<br>[3]https://github.com/apollographql/federation/security/advisories/GHSA-p2q6-pwh5-m6jr |
| 86 | CVE-2025-32032 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Apollo Router Core is a configurable, high-performance graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation 2. A vulnerability in Apollo Router allowed queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments to be prohibitively expensive to query plan, specifically due to internal optimizations being frequently bypassed. The query planner includes an optimization that significantly speeds up planning for applicable GraphQL selections. However, queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments can generate many selections where this optimization does not apply, leading to significantly longer planning times. Because the query planner does not enforce a timeout, a small number of such queries can exhaust router`s thread pool, rendering it inoperable. This could lead to excessive resource consumption and denial of service.

| 87 | CVE-2025-32033 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Apollo Router Core is a configurable, high-performance graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation 2. Prior to 1.61.2 and 2.1.1, the operation limits plugin uses unsigned 32-bit integers to track limit counters (e.g. for a query`s height). If a counter exceeded the maximum value for this data type (4,294,967,295), it wrapped around to 0, unintentionally allowing queries to bypass configured thresholds. This could occur for large queries if the payload limit were sufficiently increased, but could also occur for small queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments. This has been remediated in apollo-router versions 1.61.2 and 2.1.1. | [1]https://github.com/apollographql/router/commit/ab6675a63174715ea6ff50881fc957831d4e9564<br>[2]https://github.com/apollographql/router/commit/bba032e183b861348a466d3123c7137a1ae18952<br>[3]https://github.com/apollographql/router/security/advisories/GHSA-84m6-5m72-45fp |
