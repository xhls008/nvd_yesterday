| 12 | CVE-2024-47051 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | This advisory addresses two critical security vulnerabilities present in Mautic versions before 5.2.3. These vulnerabilities could be exploited by authenticated users.  *  Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Asset Upload: A Remote Code Execution vulnerability has been identified in the asset upload functionality. Insufficient enforcement of allowed file extensions allows an attacker to bypass restrictions and upload executable files, such as PHP scripts.  *  Path Traversal File Deletion: A Path Traversal vulnerability exists in the upload validation process. Due to improper handling of path components, an authenticated user can manipulate the file deletion process to delete arbitrary files on the host system. | [1]https://github.com/mautic/mautic/security/advisories/GHSA-73gx-x7r9-77x2<br>[2]https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Code_Injection<br>[3]https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal |
| 13 | CVE-2024-47053 | 7.7  | HIGH | This advisory addresses an authorization vulnerability in Mautic`s HTTP Basic Authentication implementation. This flaw could allow unauthorized access to sensitive report data.  *  Improper Authorization: An authorization flaw exists in Mautic`s API Authorization implementation. Any authenticated user, regardless of assigned roles or permissions, can access all reports and their associated data via the API. This bypasses the intended access controls governed by the "Reporting Permissions > View Own" and "Reporting Permissions > View Others" permissions, which should restrict access to non-System Reports. | [1]https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html<br>[2]https://docs.mautic.org/en/5.2/configuration/settings.html#api-settings<br>[3]https://github.com/mautic/mautic/security/advisories/GHSA-8xv7-g2q3-fqgc |
