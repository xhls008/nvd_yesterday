| 18 | CVE-2025-2294 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Kubio AI Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.1 via thekubio_hybrid_theme_load_template function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/kubio/tags/2.5.1/lib/integrations/third-party-themes/editor-hooks.php#L32<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/2fb44c6e-520e-4a9f-9987-8b770feb710d?source=cve |
| 19 | CVE-2025-2328 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the `dnd_remove_uploaded_files` function in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.8.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add arbitrary file paths (such as ../../../../wp-config.php) to uploaded files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when an Administrator deletes the message. Exploiting this vulnerability requires the Flamingo plugin to be installed and activated. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/drag-and-drop-multiple-file-upload-contact-form-7/trunk/inc/dnd-upload-cf7.php#L153<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3261964/<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0f6cca7a-b8ff-4ca5-b813-e611eac07695?source=cve |

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3262319%40administrator-z&new=3262319%40administrator-z&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/32725074-5c62-49e0-83f9-c6cb77fb77a4?source=cve |

| 44 | CVE-2025-29928 | 8.0  | HIGH | authentik is an open-source identity provider. Prior to versions 2024.12.4 and 2025.2.3, when authentik was configured to use the database for session storage (which is a non-default setting), deleting sessions via the Web Interface or the API would not revoke the session and the session holder would continue to have access to authentik. authentik 2025.2.3 and 2024.12.4 fix this issue. Switching to the cache-based session storage until the authentik instance can be upgraded is recommended. This will however also delete all existing sessions and users will have to re-authenticate. | [1]https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/commit/71294b7deb6eb5726a782de83b957eaf25fc4cf6<br>[2]https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/security/advisories/GHSA-p6p8-f853-9g2p |
| 45 | CVE-2025-30211 | 7.5  | HIGH | Erlang/OTP is a set of libraries for the Erlang programming language. Prior to versions OTP-27.3.1, 26.2.5.10, and 25.3.2.19, a maliciously formed KEX init message can result with high memory usage. Implementation does not verify RFC specified limits on algorithm names (64 characters) provided in KEX init message. Big KEX init packet may lead to inefficient processing of the error data. As a result, large amount of memory will be allocated for processing malicious data. Versions OTP-27.3.1, OTP-26.2.5.10, and OTP-25.3.2.19 fix the issue. Some workarounds are available. One may set option `parallel_login` to `false` and/or reduce the `max_sessions` option. | [1]https://github.com/erlang/otp/security/advisories/GHSA-vvr3-fjhh-cfwc |
