| 1 | CVE-2025-1907 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Instantel Micromate lacks authentication on a configuration port which could allow an attacker to execute commands if connected. | [1]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-25-148-04<br>[2]https://www.instantel.com/service-and-support/contact-technical-support |
| 2 | CVE-2025-41438 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The CS5000 Fire Panel is vulnerable due to a default account that exists on the panel. Even though it is possible to change this by SSHing into the device, it has remained unchanged on every installed system observed. This account is not root but holds high-level permissions that could severely impact the device`s operation if exploited. | [1]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-25-148-03<br>[2]https://www.consiliumsafety.com/en/support/ |
| 3 | CVE-2025-46352 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The CS5000 Fire Panel is vulnerable due to a hard-coded password that runs on a VNC server and is visible as a string in the binary responsible for running VNC. This password cannot be altered, allowing anyone with knowledge of it to gain remote access to the panel. Such access could enable an attacker to operate the panel remotely, potentially putting the fire panel into a non-functional state and causing serious safety issues. | [1]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-25-148-03<br>[2]https://www.consiliumsafety.com/en/support/ |
| 4 | CVE-2020-36846 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | A buffer overflow, as described in CVE-2020-8927, exists in the embedded Brotli library.  Versions of IO::Compress::Brotli prior to 0.007 included a version of the brotli library prior to version 1.0.8, where an attacker controlling the input length of a "one-shot" decompression request to a script can trigger a crash, which happens when copying over chunks of data larger than 2 GiB. It is recommended to update your IO::Compress::Brotli module to 0.007 or later. If one cannot update, we recommend to use the "streaming" API as opposed to the "one-shot" API, and impose chunk size limits. | [1]https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5v8v-66v8-mwm7<br>[2]https://github.com/google/brotli/commit/223d80cfbec8fd346e32906c732c8ede21f0cea6<br>[3]https://github.com/google/brotli/pull/826<br>[4]https://github.com/timlegge/perl-IO-Compress-Brotli/blob/8b44c83b23bb4658179e1494af4b725a1bc476bc/Changes#L52<br>[5]https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8927 |

| 12 | CVE-2025-48881 | 8.3  | HIGH | Valtimo is a platform for Business Process Automation. In versions starting from 11.0.0.RELEASE to 11.3.3.RELEASE and 12.0.0.RELEASE to 12.12.0.RELEASE, all objects for which an object-management configuration exists can be listed, viewed, edited, created or deleted by unauthorised users. If object-urls are exposed via other channels, the contents of these objects can be viewed independent of object-management configurations. At time of publication, no known patches exist.  A workaround for this issue involves overriding the endpoint security as defined in ObjectenApiHttpSecurityConfigurer and ObjectManagementHttpSecurityConfigurer. Depending on the implementation, this could result in loss of functionality. | [1]https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-backend-libraries/security/advisories/GHSA-965r-9cg9-g42p |
| 13 | CVE-2025-48865 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | Fabio is an HTTP(S) and TCP router for deploying applications managed by consul. Prior to version 1.6.6, Fabio allows clients to remove X-Forwarded headers (except X-Forwarded-For) due to a vulnerability in how it processes hop-by-hop headers. Fabio adds HTTP headers like X-Forwarded-Host and X-Forwarded-Port when routing requests to backend applications. Since the receiving application should trust these headers, allowing HTTP clients to remove or modify them creates potential security vulnerabilities. Some of these custom headers can be removed and, in certain cases, manipulated. The attack relies on the behavior that headers can be defined as hop-by-hop via the HTTP Connection header. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.6. | [1]https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/commit/fdaf1e966162e9dd3b347ffdd0647b39dc71a1a3<br>[2]https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/releases/tag/v1.6.6<br>[3]https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/security/advisories/GHSA-q7p4-7xjv-j3wf<br>[4]https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/security/advisories/GHSA-q7p4-7xjv-j3wf |
| 14 | CVE-2025-48936 | 8.1  | HIGH | Zitadel is open-source identity infrastructure software. Prior to versions 2.70.12, 2.71.10, and 3.2.2, a potential vulnerability exists in the password reset mechanism. ZITADEL utilizes the Forwarded or X-Forwarded-Host header from incoming requests to construct the URL for the password reset confirmation link. This link, containing a secret code, is then emailed to the user. If an attacker can manipulate these headers (e.g., via host header injection), they could cause ZITADEL to generate a password reset link pointing to a malicious domain controlled by the attacker. If the user clicks this manipulated link in the email, the secret reset code embedded in the URL can be captured by the attacker. This captured code could then be used to reset the user`s password and gain unauthorized access to their account. This specific attack vector is mitigated for accounts that have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Passwordless authentication enabled. This issue has been patched in versions 2.70.12, 2.71.10, and 3.2.2. | [1]https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/commit/c097887bc5f680e12c998580fb56d98a15758f53<br>[2]https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/security/advisories/GHSA-93m4-mfpg-c3xf |

| 17 | CVE-2025-5190 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Browse As plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 0.2. This is due to incorrect authentication checking in the `IS_BA_Browse_As::notice` function with the `is_ba_original_user_COOKIEHASH` cookie value. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the user id. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/browse-as/tags/0.2/browse-as.php#L115<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/browse-as/tags/0.2/browse-as.php#L92<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/8f5722b0-0d54-4c44-b168-a886da1077cb?source=cve |
