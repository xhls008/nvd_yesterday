|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2024-13091 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The WPBot Pro Wordpress Chatbot plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the `qcld_wpcfb_file_upload` function in all versions up to, and including, 13.5.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. Note: The exploit requires thee ChatBot Conversational Forms plugin and the Conversational Form Builder Pro addon plugin. | [1]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0f9b6979-2662-4d2f-9656-b880dd80832c?source=cve<br>[2]https://www.wpbot.pro/ |
| 2 | CVE-2024-11218 | 8.6  | HIGH | A vulnerability was found in `podman build` and `buildah.` This issue occurs in a container breakout by using --jobs=2 and a race condition when building a malicious Containerfile.

| 3 | CVE-2024-12857 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The AdForest theme for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.8. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user`s identity prior to logging them in as that user. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to authenticate as any user as long as they have configured OTP login by phone number. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/adforest-classified-wordpress-theme/19481695<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/4ff3b4f1-dd36-43d0-b472-55a940907437?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2025-0428 | 7.2  | HIGH | The "AI Power: Complete AI Pack" plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in versions up to, and including, 1.8.96 via deserialization of untrusted input from the $form[`post_content`] variable through the wpaicg_export_prompts function. This allows authenticated attackers, with administrative privileges, to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3224162/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/66a3abc1-0508-4ce3-952b-7dbf3738879a?source=cve |
