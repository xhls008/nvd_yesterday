|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2024-37361 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | The application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid. (CWE-502) Hitachi Vantara Pentaho Business Analytics Server versions before 10.2.0.0 and 9.3.0.9, including 8.3.x, deserialize untrusted JSON data without constraining the parser to approved classes and methods. When developers place no restrictions on "gadget chains," or series of instances and method invocations that can self-execute during the deserialization process (i.e., before the object is returned to the caller), it is sometimes possible for attackers to leverage them to perform unauthorized actions. | [1]https://support.pentaho.com/hc/en-us/articles/34299135441805--Resolved-Hitachi-Vantara-Pentaho-Business-Analytics-Server-Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data-Versions-before-10-2-0-0-and-9-3-0-9-including-8-3-x-Impacted-CVE-2024-37361 |
| 2 | CVE-2025-1293 | 8.2  | HIGH | Hermes versions up to 0.4.0 improperly validated the JWT provided when using the AWS ALB authentication mode, potentially allowing for authentication bypass. This vulnerability, CVE-2025-1293, was fixed in Hermes 0.5.0. | [1]https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2025-03-hashicorp-hermes-improperly-validates-aws-alb-jwts-which-may-lead-to-authentication-bypass/73371 |
| 3 | CVE-2025-1492 | 7.8  | HIGH | Bundle Protocol and CBOR dissector crashes in Wireshark 4.4.0 to 4.4.3 and 4.2.0 to 4.2.10 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file | [1]https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/20373<br>[2]https://www.wireshark.org/security/wnpa-sec-2025-01.html |
| 4 | CVE-2024-13888 | 7.2  | HIGH | The WPMobile.App plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Open Redirect in all versions up to, and including, 11.56. This is due to insufficient validation on the redirect URL supplied via the `redirect` parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to redirect users to potentially malicious sites if they can successfully trick them into performing an action. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3243366<br>[2]https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpappninja/#developers<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/a139f0fc-f3e0-4759-aa8d-ba138e5ccc87?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2024-13476 | 7.5  | HIGH | The LTL Freight Quotes – GlobalTranz Edition plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the `engtz_wd_save_dropship` AJAX endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.11 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3242457/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/7eb7c846-c82b-40c8-a5ae-88b30c761ba9?source=cve |
| 6 | CVE-2024-13753 | 8.1  | HIGH | The Ultimate Classified Listings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the update_profile function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify victim`s email via a forged request, which might lead to account takeover, granted they can trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ultimate-classified-listings/tags/1.4/classes/class-shortcodes.php#L701<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/61365b95-da97-425d-a314-648b3d00236f?source=cve |
| 7 | CVE-2024-13789 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The ravpage plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 2.31 via deserialization of untrusted input from the `paramsv2` parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ravpage/trunk/ravpage.php#L24<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/5e0bcf70-2ffc-45c8-b63e-a8376b6cd22b?source=cve |
| 8 | CVE-2024-13792 | 7.3  | HIGH | The WooCommerce Food - Restaurant Menu & Food ordering plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.2. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. | [1]https://codecanyon.net/item/woocommerce-food-restaurant-menu-food-ordering/25457330<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/ec425326-2729-4142-b5f4-460dfd3ed773?source=cve |
| 9 | CVE-2024-49781 | 7.1  | HIGH | IBM OpenPages with Watson 8.3 and 9.0 IBM OpenPages is vulnerable to an XML external entity injection (XXE) attack when processing XML data.

| 10 | CVE-2025-1039 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Lenix Elementor Leads addon plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via a URL form field in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3237538/lenix-elementor-leads-addon<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/29f835c8-769a-47c0-832f-622860b1c59c?source=cve<br>[3]https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/0d1abaf9-4044-4dcc-95df-73f23a8a5a9f/ |

| 17 | CVE-2025-24893 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Any guest can perform arbitrary remote code execution through a request to `SolrSearch`. This impacts the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. To reproduce on an instance, without being logged in, go to `<host>/xwiki/bin/get/Main/SolrSearch?media=rss&text=%7D%7D%7D%7B%7Basync%20async%3Dfalse%7D%7D%7B%7Bgroovy%7D%7Dprintln%28"Hello%20from"%20%2B%20"%20search%20text%3A"%20%2B%20%2823%20%2B%2019%29%29%7B%7B%2Fgroovy%7D%7D%7B%7B%2Fasync%7D%7D%20`. If there is an output, and the title of the RSS feed contains `Hello from search text:42`, then the instance is vulnerable. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.10.11, 16.4.1 and 16.5.0RC1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may edit `Main.SolrSearchMacros` in `SolrSearchMacros.xml` on line 955 to match the `rawResponse` macro in `macros.vm#L2824` with a content type of `application/xml`, instead of simply outputting the content of the feed. | [1]https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/568447cad5172d97d6bbcfda9f6183689c2cf086/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-search/xwiki-platform-search-solr/xwiki-platform-search-solr-ui/src/main/resources/Main/SolrSearchMacros.xml#L955<br>[2]https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/67021db9b8ed26c2236a653269302a86bf01ef40/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-web/xwiki-platform-web-templates/src/main/resources/templates/macros.vm#L2824<br>[3]https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/67021db9b8ed26c2236a653269302a86bf01ef40<br>[4]https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-rr6p-3pfg-562j<br>[5]https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-22149 |
