|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2025-8417 | 8.1  | HIGH | The Catalog Importer, Scraper & Crawler plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP code injection in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.4. This is due to reliance on a guessable numeric token (e.g. ?key= 900001705) without proper authentication, combined with the unsafe use of eval() on user-supplied input. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server via a forged request granted they can guess or brute-force the numeric key. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/intelligent-importer/tags/5.1.4/communication.php#L20<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/intelligent-importer/tags/5.1.4/communication.php#L244<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/intelligent-importer/tags/5.1.4/communication.php#L272<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/intelligent-importer/tags/5.1.4/communication.php#L300<br>[5]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/intelligent-importer/tags/5.1.4/megaimporter.php#L57<br>[6]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/3eb3533c-e33c-41db-b9cf-e9d71a0a5588?source=cve |

| 16 | CVE-2025-58060 | 8.0  | HIGH | OpenPrinting CUPS is an open source printing system for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. In versions 2.4.12 and earlier, when the `AuthType` is set to anything but `Basic`, if the request contains an `Authorization: Basic ...` header, the password is not checked. This results in authentication bypass. Any configuration that allows an `AuthType` that is not `Basic` is affected. Version 2.4.13 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups/commit/595d691075b1d396d2edfaa0a8fd0873a0a1f221<br>[2]https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups/security/advisories/GHSA-4c68-qgrh-rmmq |
| 17 | CVE-2025-59053 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | AIRI is a self-hosted, artificial intelligence based Grok Companion. In v0.7.2-beta.2 in the `packages/stage-ui/src/components/MarkdownRenderer.vue` path, the Markdown content is processed using the useMarkdown composable, and the processed HTML is rendered directly into the DOM using v-html. An attacker creates a card file containing malicious HTML/JavaScript, then simply processes it using the highlightTagToHtml function (which simply replaces template tags without HTML escaping), and then directly renders it using v-html, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS). The project also exposes the Tauri API, which can be called from the frontend. The MCP plugin exposes a command execution interface function in `crates/tauri-plugin-mcp/src/lib.rs`. This allows arbitrary command execution. `connect_server` directly passes the user-supplied `command` and `args` parameters to `Command::new(command).args(args)` without any input validation or whitelisting. Thus, the previous XSS exploit could achieve command execution through this interface. v0.7.2-beta.3 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/moeru-ai/airi/commit/3315634903c9102a19e8f0476970df01801c8ca4<br>[2]https://github.com/moeru-ai/airi/security/advisories/GHSA-9832-f8jx-hw6f<br>[3]https://github.com/moeru-ai/airi/security/advisories/GHSA-9832-f8jx-hw6f |
