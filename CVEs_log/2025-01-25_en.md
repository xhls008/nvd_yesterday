| 1 | CVE-2025-0314 | 8.7  | HIGH | An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 17.2 before 17.6.4, 17.7 before 17.7.3, and 17.8 before 17.8.1. Improper rendering of certain file types lead to cross-site scripting. | [1]https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/512118<br>[2]https://hackerone.com/reports/2922313 |
| 2 | CVE-2024-13545 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Bootstrap Ultimate theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.9 via the path parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include PHP files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where PHP files can be uploaded and included. If php://filter is enabled on the server, this issue may directly lead to Remote Code Execution. | [1]https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/browser/bootstrap-ultimate/1.4.9/docs/index.php#L8<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/ae07af10-e5fc-4f28-a343-f56c0e2bc324?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2024-13408 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Post Grid, Slider & Carousel Ultimate – with Shortcode, Gutenberg Block & Elementor Widget plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.10 via the `theme` attribute of the `pgcu` shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where php files can be uploaded and included. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3227281/post-grid-carousel-ultimate/tags/1.7/includes/classes/shortcode.php<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/ff346465-62c2-4a2b-8a4a-c88558d7cabd?source=cve |

Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.361, the missing authorization allows any authenticated user to attach any existing private key on a coolify instance to his own server. If the server configuration of IP / domain, port (most likely 22) and user (root) matches with the victim`s server configuration, then the attacker can use the `Terminal` feature and execute arbitrary commands on the victim`s server.

Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.361, the missing authorization allows any authenticated user to escalate his or any other team members privileges to any role, including the owner role. He`s also able to kick every other member out of the team, including admins and owners. This allows the attacker to access the `Terminal` feature and execute remote commands.

| 41 | CVE-2025-23222 | 8.4  | HIGH | An issue was discovered in Deepin dde-api-proxy through 1.0.19 in which unprivileged users can access D-Bus services as root. Specifically, dde-api-proxy runs as root and forwards messages from arbitrary local users to legacy D-Bus methods in the actual D-Bus services, and the actual D-Bus services don`t know about the proxy situation (they believe that root is asking them to do things). Consequently several proxied methods, that shouldn`t be accessible to non-root users, are accessible to non-root users. In situations where Polkit is involved, the caller would be treated as admin, resulting in a similar escalation of privileges. | [1]https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1229918<br>[2]https://security.opensuse.org/2025/01/24/dde-api-proxy-privilege-escalation.html<br>[3]https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/01/24/3 |
| 42 | CVE-2025-24359 | 8.4  | HIGH | ASTEVAL is an evaluator of Python expressions and statements. Prior to version 1.0.6, if an attacker can control the input to the `asteval` library, they can bypass asteval`s restrictions and execute arbitrary Python code in the context of the application using the library. The vulnerability is rooted in how `asteval` performs handling of `FormattedValue` AST nodes. In particular, the `on_formattedvalue` value uses the dangerous format method of the str class. The code allows an attacker to manipulate the value of the string used in the dangerous call `fmt.format(__fstring__=val)`. This vulnerability can be exploited to access protected attributes by intentionally triggering an `AttributeError` exception. The attacker can then catch the exception and use its `obj` attribute to gain arbitrary access to sensitive or protected object properties. Version 1.0.6 fixes this issue. | [1]https://github.com/lmfit/asteval/blob/cfb57f0beebe0dc0520a1fbabc35e66060c7ea71/asteval/asteval.py#L507<br>[2]https://github.com/lmfit/asteval/security/advisories/GHSA-3wwr-3g9f-9gc7<br>[3]https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2016/12/29/careful-with-str-format |
