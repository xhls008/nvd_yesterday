| 1 | CVE-2025-54136 | 7.2  | HIGH | Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions 1.2.4 and below, attackers can achieve remote and persistent code execution by modifying an already trusted MCP configuration file inside a shared GitHub repository or editing the file locally on the target`s machine. Once a collaborator accepts a harmless MCP, the attacker can silently swap it for a malicious command (e.g., calc.exe) without triggering any warning or re-prompt. If an attacker has write permissions on a user`s active branches of a source repository that contains existing MCP servers the user has previously approved, or allows an attacker has arbitrary file-write locally, the attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution. This is fixed in version 1.3. | [1]https://github.com/cursor/cursor/security/advisories/GHSA-24mc-g4xr-4395 |
| 2 | CVE-2025-54796 | 7.5  | HIGH | Copyparty is a portable file server. Versions prior to 1.18.9, the filter parameter for the "Recent Uploads" page allows arbitrary RegExes. If this feature is enabled (which is the default), an attacker can craft a filter which deadlocks the server. This is fixed in version 1.18.9. | [1]https://github.com/9001/copyparty/commit/09910ba80784c3980947d92f45db696398c0fd83<br>[2]https://github.com/9001/copyparty/releases/tag/v1.18.9<br>[3]https://github.com/9001/copyparty/security/advisories/GHSA-5662-2rj7-f2v6 |
| 3 | CVE-2025-6754 | 8.8  | HIGH | The SEO Metrics plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to missing authorization checks in both the seo_metrics_handle_connect_button_click() AJAX handler and the seo_metrics_handle_custom_endpoint() function in versions 1.0.5 through 1.0.15. Because the AJAX action only verifies a nonce, without checking the caller’s capabilities, a subscriber-level user can retrieve the token and then access the custom endpoint to obtain full administrator cookies. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/seo-metrics-helper/trunk/common-functions.php<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/seo-metrics-helper/trunk/endpoint.php<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/seo-metrics-helper/trunk/seo-metrics.php<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/seo-metrics-helper/trunk/welcome-page.php<br>[5]https://wordpress.org/plugins/seo-metrics-helper/#developers<br>[6]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/48658b33-ae53-4919-8180-1188f72553f7?source=cve |
