| 1 | CVE-2025-2185 | 8.0  | HIGH | ALBEDO Telecom Net.Time - PTP/NTP clock (Serial No. NBC0081P) software release 1.4.4 is vulnerable to an insufficient session expiration vulnerability, which could permit an attacker to transmit passwords over unencrypted connections, resulting in the product becoming vulnerable to interception. | [1]https://www.albedotelecom.com/contactus.php<br>[2]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-25-114-02 |
| 2 | CVE-2025-3606 | 7.5  | HIGH | Vestel AC Charger version 3.75.0 contains a vulnerability that could enable an attacker to access files containing sensitive information, such as credentials which could be used to further compromise the device. | [1]https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vestel-shield.firebasestorage.app/o/PRODUCTION%2F1%2FVSA-1_R2.pdf?alt=media&token=8201f299-5014-4720-9200-f1b335736ac1<br>[2]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-25-114-03 |
| 3 | CVE-2025-43864 | 7.5  | HIGH | React Router is a router for React. Starting in version 7.2.0 and prior to version 7.5.2, it is possible to force an application to switch to SPA mode by adding a header to the request. If the application uses SSR and is forced to switch to SPA, this causes an error that completely corrupts the page. If a cache system is in place, this allows the response containing the error to be cached, resulting in a cache poisoning that strongly impacts the availability of the application. This issue has been patched in version 7.5.2. | [1]https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/e6c53a0130559b4a9bd47f9cf76ea5b08a69868a/packages/react-router/lib/server-runtime/server.ts#L407<br>[2]https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/commit/c84302972a152d851cf5dd859ff332b354b70111<br>[3]https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/security/advisories/GHSA-f46r-rw29-r322 |
| 4 | CVE-2025-43865 | 8.2  | HIGH | React Router is a router for React. In versions on the 7.0 branch prior to version 7.5.2, it`s possible to modify pre-rendered data by adding a header to the request. This allows to completely spoof its contents and modify all the values ​​of the data object passed to the HTML. This issue has been patched in version 7.5.2. | [1]https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/e6c53a0130559b4a9bd47f9cf76ea5b08a69868a/packages/react-router/lib/server-runtime/routes.ts#L87<br>[2]https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/commit/c84302972a152d851cf5dd859ff332b354b70111<br>[3]https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/security/advisories/GHSA-cpj6-fhp6-mr6j |

| 9 | CVE-2025-1279 | 8.8  | HIGH | The BM Content Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the ux_cb_tools_import_item_ajax AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 3.16.2.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/art-simple-clean-wordpress-theme-for-creatives/20170299<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e4632899-c3bf-48f3-8a69-8fa32bfd902d?source=cve |
| 10 | CVE-2025-1565 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Mayosis Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Read in all versions up to, and including, 5.4.1 via the library/wave-audio/peaks/remote_dl.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/mayosis-digital-marketplace-theme/20210200<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b967eb98-69f8-41c5-a19a-9d20979accb0?source=cve |
| 11 | CVE-2024-11917 | 8.1  | HIGH | The JobSearch WP Job Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.8. This is due to improper configurations in the `jobsearch_xing_response_data_callback`, `set_access_tokes`, and `google_callback` functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as the first connected Xing user, or any connected Xing user if the Xing id is known. It is also possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as the first connected Google user if the user has logged in, without subsequently logging out, in thirty days. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 2.8.4. | [1]https://codecanyon.net/item/jobsearch-wp-job-board-wordpress-plugin/21066856<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6de8a608-8715-4f9c-9f2f-df60dd1cc579?source=cve |
| 12 | CVE-2025-2470 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Service Finder Bookings plugin for WordPress, used by the Service Finder - Directory and Job Board WordPress Theme, is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 5.1. This is due to a lack of restriction on user role in the `nsl_registration_store_extra_input` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register an account on the site with an arbitrary role, including Administrator, when registering via a social login. The Nextend Social Login plugin must be installed and configured to exploit the vulnerability. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/service-finder-service-and-business-listing-wordpress-theme/15208793<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/a1f62cda-262b-46d9-a839-0a573813cfa1?source=cve |

| 19 | CVE-2025-43862 | 7.6  | HIGH | Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Prior to version 0.6.12, a normal user is able to access and modify APP orchestration, even though the web UI of APP orchestration is not presented for a normal user. This access control flaw allows non-admin users to make unauthorized access and changes on the APPSs. This issue has been patched in version 0.6.12. A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the the access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role permissions and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only users with admin privileges can access Orchestration of the APPs. | [1]https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/5266<br>[2]https://github.com/langgenius/dify/security/advisories/GHSA-6pw4-jqhv-3626 |
| 20 | CVE-2025-3928 | 8.8  | HIGH | Commvault Web Server has an unspecified vulnerability that can be exploited by a remote, authenticated attacker.

| 21 | CVE-2025-25775 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Codeastro Bus Ticket Booking System v1.0 is vulnerable to SQL injection via the kodetiket parameter in /BusTicket-CI/tiket/cekorder. | [1]https://codeastro.com/bus-ticket-booking-system-in-php-codeigniter-with-source-code/<br>[2]https://github.com/arunmodi/Vulnerability-Research/tree/main/CVE-2025-25775<br>[3]https://github.com/arunmodi/Vulnerability-Research/tree/main/CVE-2025-25775 |
| 22 | CVE-2025-3935 | 8.1  | HIGH | ScreenConnect versions 25.2.3 and earlier versions may be susceptible to a ViewState code injection attack. ASP.NET Web Forms use ViewState to preserve page and control state, with data encoded using Base64 protected by machine keys. It is important to note that to obtain these machine keys, privileged system level access must be obtained. If these machine keys are compromised, attackers could create and send a malicious ViewState to the website, potentially leading to remote code execution on the server. The risk does not originate from a vulnerability introduced by ScreenConnect, but from platform level behavior.  This had no direct impact to ScreenConnect Client. ScreenConnect 2025.4 patch disables ViewState and removes any dependency on it. | [1]https://www.connectwise.com/company/trust/advisories<br>[2]https://www.connectwise.com/company/trust/security-bulletins/screenconnect-security-patch-2025.4 |
