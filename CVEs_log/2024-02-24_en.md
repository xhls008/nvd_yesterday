| 10 | CVE-2023-51388 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Hertzbeat is a real-time monitoring system. In `CalculateAlarm.java`, `AviatorEvaluator` is used to directly execute the expression function, and no security policy is configured, resulting in AviatorScript (which can execute any static method by default) script injection. Version 1.4.1 fixes this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/dromara/hertzbeat/commit/8dcf050e27ca95d15460a7ba98a3df8a9cd1d3d2<br>[2]https://github.com/dromara/hertzbeat/security/advisories/GHSA-mcqg-gqxr-hqgj |
| 11 | CVE-2023-51389 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Hertzbeat is a real-time monitoring system. At the interface of `/define/yml`, SnakeYAML is used as a parser to parse yml content, but no security configuration is used, resulting in a YAML deserialization vulnerability. Version 1.4.1 fixes this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/dromara/hertzbeat/commit/97c3f14446d1c96d1fc993df111684926b6cce17<br>[2]https://github.com/dromara/hertzbeat/security/advisories/GHSA-rmvr-9p5x-mm96 |
| 12 | CVE-2023-51653 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Hertzbeat is a real-time monitoring system. In the implementation of `JmxCollectImpl.java`, `JMXConnectorFactory.connect` is vulnerable to JNDI injection. The corresponding interface is `/api/monitor/detect`. If there is a URL field, the address will be used by default. When the URL is `service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://xxxxxxx:1099/localHikari`, it can be exploited to cause remote code execution. Version 1.4.1 contains a fix for this issue. | [1]https://github.com/dromara/hertzbeat/commit/f794b0d82be49c596c04a042976446559eb315ef<br>[2]https://github.com/dromara/hertzbeat/security/advisories/GHSA-gcmp-vf6v-59gg |
| 13 | CVE-2024-26151 | 8.2  | HIGH | The `mjml` PyPI package, found at the `FelixSchwarz/mjml-python` GitHub repo, is an unofficial Python port of MJML, a markup language created by Mailjet. All users of `FelixSchwarz/mjml-python` who insert untrusted data into mjml templates unless that data is checked in a very strict manner. User input like `&lt;script&gt;` would be rendered as `<script>` in the final HTML output. The attacker must be able to control some data which is later injected in an mjml template which is then send out as email to other users. The attacker could control contents of email messages sent through the platform. The problem has been fixed in version 0.11.0 of this library. Versions before 0.10.0 are not affected by this security issue. As a workaround, ensure that potentially untrusted user input does not contain any sequences which could be rendered as HTML. | [1]https://github.com/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/commit/84c495da20a91640a1ca551ace17df7f3be644aa<br>[2]https://github.com/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/commit/8d410b7a500703080bb14ed7e3d2663fe16767e6<br>[3]https://github.com/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/issues/52<br>[4]https://github.com/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/releases/tag/v0.11.0<br>[5]https://github.com/FelixSchwarz/mjml-python/security/advisories/GHSA-578p-fxmm-6229 |
