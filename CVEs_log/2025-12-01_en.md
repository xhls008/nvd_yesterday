| 1 | CVE-2025-13615 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The StreamTube Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary User Password Change in versions up to, and including, 4.78. This is due to the plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization and access system resources. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts. Note: This can only be exploited if the `registration password fields` enabled in theme options. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/streamtube-responsive-video-wordpress-theme/33821786<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b812a0d7-99a1-4f61-b78a-78cea6a2ada1?source=cve |
