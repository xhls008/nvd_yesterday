| 10 | CVE-2025-55741 | 8.1  | HIGH | UnoPim is an open-source Product Information Management (PIM) system built on the Laravel framework. In versions 0.3.0 and earlier, users without the Delete privilege for products are unable to delete individual products via the standard endpoint, as expected. However, these users can bypass intended access controls by issuing requests to the mass-delete endpoint, allowing them to delete products without proper authorization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized product deletion, leading to potential data loss and business disruption. The issue is fixed in version 0.3.1. No known workarounds exist. | [1]https://github.com/unopim/unopim/commit/c14eebe653aafd8dc713ca729165177e63315989<br>[2]https://github.com/unopim/unopim/security/advisories/GHSA-8p2f-fx4q-75cx<br>[3]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_WV8fCXlJM<br>[4]https://github.com/unopim/unopim/security/advisories/GHSA-8p2f-fx4q-75cx<br>[5]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_WV8fCXlJM |

| 14 | CVE-2025-57771 | 8.1  | HIGH | Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent that lives in users` editors. In versions prior to 3.25.5, Roo-Code fails to properly handle process substitution and single ampersand characters in the command parsing logic for auto-execute commands. If a user has enabled auto-approved execution for a command such as ls, an attacker who can submit crafted prompts to the agent may inject arbitrary commands to be executed alongside the intended command. Exploitation requires attacker access to submit prompts and for the user to have enabled auto-approved command execution, which is disabled by default. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The issue is fixed in version 3.25.5. | [1]https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/commit/de359a465c67aefc67553aa2b464591b602c4bdc<br>[2]https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/security/advisories/GHSA-wrh9-463x-7wvv |
| 15 | CVE-2025-57800 | 8.8  | HIGH | Audiobookshelf is an open-source self-hosted audiobook server. In versions 2.6.0 through 2.26.3, the application does not properly restrict redirect callback URLs during OIDC authentication. An attacker can craft a login link that causes Audiobookshelf to store an arbitrary callback in a cookie, which is later used to redirect the user after authentication. The server then issues a 302 redirect to the attacker-controlled URL, appending sensitive OIDC tokens as query parameters. This allows an attacker to obtain the victim`s tokens and perform full account takeover, including creating persistent admin users if the victim is an administrator. Tokens are further leaked via browser history, Referer headers, and server logs. This vulnerability impacts all Audiobookshelf deployments using OIDC; no IdP misconfiguration is required. The issue is fixed in version 2.28.0. No known workarounds exist. | [1]https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/commit/99a3867ce934b797e21e6ba5390d4b679e35f7cb<br>[2]https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/security/advisories/GHSA-vpc2-w73p-39px |

| 20 | CVE-2025-55581 | 7.3  | HIGH | D-Link DCS-825L firmware version 1.08.01 and possibly prior versions contain an insecure implementation in the mydlink-watch-dog.sh script. The script monitors and respawns the `dcp` and `signalc` binaries without validating their integrity, origin, or permissions. An attacker with filesystem access (e.g., via UART or firmware modification) may replace these binaries to achieve persistent arbitrary code execution with root privileges. The issue stems from improper handling of executable trust and absence of integrity checks in the watchdog logic. | [1]https://cybermaya.in/posts/Post-42/<br>[2]https://legacy.us.dlink.com/pages/product.aspx?id=f9c0458bfe7b4ff3bf7fad1cf6fcc9a1<br>[3]https://www.dlink.com/en/security-bulletin/ |
