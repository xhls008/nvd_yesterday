| 75 | CVE-2025-27513 | 7.5  | HIGH | OpenTelemetry dotnet is a dotnet telemetry framework. A vulnerability in OpenTelemetry.Api package 1.10.0 to 1.11.1 could cause a Denial of Service (DoS) when a tracestate and traceparent header is received. Even if an application does not explicitly use trace context propagation, receiving these headers can still trigger high CPU usage. This issue impacts any application accessible over the web or backend services that process HTTP requests containing a tracestate header. Application may experience excessive resource consumption, leading to increased latency, degraded performance, or downtime. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.11.2. | [1]https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/commit/1b555c1201413f2f55f2cd3c4ba03ef4b615b6b5<br>[2]https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/security/advisories/GHSA-8785-wc3w-h8q6 |

| 77 | CVE-2025-27508 | 7.5  | HIGH | Emissary is a P2P based data-driven workflow engine. The ChecksumCalculator class within allows for hashing and checksum generation, but it includes or defaults to algorithms that are no longer recommended for secure cryptographic use cases (e.g., SHA-1, CRC32, and SSDEEP). These algorithms, while possibly valid for certain non-security-critical tasks, can expose users to security risks if used in scenarios where strong cryptographic guarantees are required. This issue is fixed in 8.24.0. | [1]https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/emissary/commit/da3a81a8977577597ff2a944820a5ae4e9762368<br>[2]https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/emissary/security/advisories/GHSA-hw43-fcmm-3m5g |
