| 12 | CVE-2026-25991 | 7.7  | HIGH | Tandoor Recipes is an application for managing recipes, planning meals, and building shopping lists. Prior to 2.5.1, there is a Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the Cookmate recipe import feature of Tandoor Recipes. The application fails to validate the destination URL after following HTTP redirects, allowing any authenticated user (including standard users without administrative privileges) to force the server to connect to arbitrary internal or external resources. The vulnerability lies in cookbook/integration/cookmate.py, within the Cookmate integration class. This vulnerability can be leveraged to scan internal network ports, access cloud instance metadata (e.g., AWS/GCP Metadata Service), or disclose the server`s real IP address. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.5.1. | [1]https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes/commit/fdf22c5e745740db1fec29d6b4bd3df5d340e6ab<br>[2]https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes/releases/tag/2.5.1<br>[3]https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes/security/advisories/GHSA-j6xg-85mh-qqf7 |
| 13 | CVE-2026-26187 | 8.1  | HIGH | lakeFS is an open-source tool that transforms object storage into a Git-like repositories. Prior to 1.77.0, the local block adapter (pkg/block/local/adapter.go) allows authenticated users to read and write files outside their designated storage boundaries. The verifyRelPath function used strings.HasPrefix() to verify that requested paths fall within the configured storage directory. This check was insufficient because it validated only the path prefix without requiring a path separator, allowing access to sibling directories with similar names. Also, the adapter verified that resolved paths stayed within the adapter`s base path, but did not verify that object identifiers stayed within their designated storage namespace. This allowed attackers to use path traversal sequences in the object identifier to access files in other namespaces. Fixed in version v1.77.0. | [1]https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS/commit/cbc106275357302a834280f133265dc39f1384ce<br>[2]https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS/releases/tag/v1.77.0<br>[3]https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS/security/advisories/GHSA-699m-4v95-rmpm |
| 14 | CVE-2026-26190 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Milvus is an open-source vector database built for generative AI applications. Prior to 2.5.27 and 2.6.10, Milvus exposes TCP port 9091 by default, which enables authentication bypasses. The /expr debug endpoint uses a weak, predictable default authentication token derived from etcd.rootPath (default: by-dev), enabling arbitrary expression evaluation. The full REST API (/api/v1/*) is registered on the metrics/management port without any authentication, allowing unauthenticated access to all business operations including data manipulation and credential management. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.5.27 and 2.6.10. | [1]https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/commit/92b74dd2e286006a83b4a5f07951027b32e718a9<br>[2]https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/releases/tag/v2.5.27<br>[3]https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/releases/tag/v2.6.10<br>[4]https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/security/advisories/GHSA-7ppg-37fh-vcr6 |
| 15 | CVE-2026-26208 | 7.8  | HIGH | ADB Explorer is a fluent UI for ADB on Windows. Prior to Beta 0.9.26020, ADB Explorer is vulnerable to Insecure Deserialization leading to Remote Code Execution. The application attempts to deserialize the App.txt settings file using Newtonsoft.Json with TypeNameHandling set to Objects. This allows an attacker to supply a crafted JSON file containing a gadget chain (e.g., ObjectDataProvider) to execute arbitrary code when the application launches and subsequently saves its settings. This vulnerability is fixed in Beta 0.9.26020. | [1]https://github.com/Alex4SSB/ADB-Explorer/commit/776f132cede86e1405520f2a28c78276dda5ab5a<br>[2]https://github.com/Alex4SSB/ADB-Explorer/issues/294<br>[3]https://github.com/Alex4SSB/ADB-Explorer/releases/tag/v0.9.26020<br>[4]https://github.com/Alex4SSB/ADB-Explorer/security/advisories/GHSA-49qx-wpxj-p4mh |

| 17 | CVE-2025-15157 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Starfish Review Generation & Marketing for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the `srm_restore_options_defaults` function in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.19. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/starfish-reviews/tags/3.1.18/init/actions/ajax/starfish-ajax-callbacks.action.php#L46<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/064e7ea2-949e-4f5b-adba-0890f8c6ad25?source=cve |
