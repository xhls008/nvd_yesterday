| 1 | CVE-2025-4665 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | WordPress plugin Contact Form CFDB7 versions up to and including 1.3.2 are affected by a pre-authentication SQL injection vulnerability that cascades into insecure deserialization (PHP Object Injection). The weakness arises due to insufficient validation of user input in plugin endpoints, allowing crafted input to influence backend queries in unexpected ways. Using specially crafted payloads, this can escalate into unsafe deserialization, enabling arbitrary object injection in PHP. Although the issue is remotely exploitable without authentication, it does require a crafted interaction with the affected endpoint in order to trigger successfully. | [1]https://github.com/mandiant/Vulnerability-Disclosures/blob/master/2025/MNDT-2025-0006.md<br>[2]https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-cfdb7 |

| 17 | CVE-2025-64101 | 8.1  | HIGH | Zitadel is open-source identity infrastructure software. Prior to 4.6.0, 3.4.3, and 2.71.18, a potential vulnerability exists in ZITADEL`s password reset mechanism. ZITADEL utilizes the Forwarded or X-Forwarded-Host header from incoming requests to construct the URL for the password reset confirmation link. This link, containing a secret code, is then emailed to the user. If an attacker can manipulate these headers (e.g., via host header injection), they could cause ZITADEL to generate a password reset link pointing to a malicious domain controlled by the attacker. If the user clicks this manipulated link in the email, the secret reset code embedded in the URL can be captured by the attacker. This captured code could then be used to reset the user`s password and gain unauthorized access to their account. It`s important to note that this specific attack vector is mitigated for accounts that have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Passwordless authentication enabled. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.6.0, 3.4.3, and 2.71.18. | [1]https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/commit/72a5c33e6ac302b978d564bd049f9364f5a989b1<br>[2]https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/security/advisories/GHSA-mwmh-7px9-4c23 |
