| 1 | CVE-2024-4225 | 7.6  | HIGH | Multiple security vulnerabilities has been discovered in web interface of NetGuardian DIN Remote Telemetry Unit (RTU), by DPS Telecom. Attackers can exploit those security vulnerabilities to perform critical actions such as escalate user`s privilege, steal user`s credential, Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). | [1]https://govtech-csg.github.io/security-advisories/2024/04/29/CVE-2024-4225.html |
| 2 | CVE-2024-1895 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Event Monster – Event Management, Tickets Booking, Upcoming Event plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.4 via deserialization via shortcode of untrusted input from a custom meta value. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/event-monster/tags/1.3.3/shortcode.php<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/41d7b3f1-a133-4678-b2d9-3f9951cbc005?source=cve |

| 15 | CVE-2024-32970 | 7.1  | HIGH | Phlex is a framework for building object-oriented views in Ruby. In affected versions there is a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited via maliciously crafted user data. Since the last two vulnerabilities https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/security/advisories/GHSA-242p-4v39-2v8g and https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/security/advisories/GHSA-g7xq-xv8c-h98c, we have invested in extensive browser tests. It was these new tests that helped us uncover these issues. As of now the project exercises every possible attack vector the developers can think of — including enumerating every ASCII character, and we run these tests in Chrome, Firefox and Safari. Additionally, we test against a list of 6613 known XSS payloads (see: payloadbox/xss-payload-list). The reason these issues were not detected before is the escapes were working as designed. However, their design didn`t take into account just how recklessly permissive browsers are when it comes to executing unsafe JavaScript via HTML attributes. If you render an `<a>` tag with an `href` attribute set to a user-provided link, that link could potentially execute JavaScript when clicked by another user. If you splat user-provided attributes when rendering any HTML or SVG tag, malicious event attributes could be included in the output, executing JavaScript when the events are triggered by another user. Patches are available on RubyGems for all minor versions released in the last year. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should configure a Content Security Policy that does not allow `unsafe-inline` which would effectively prevent this vulnerability from being exploited. Users who upgrade are also advised to configure a Content Security Policy header that does not allow `unsafe-inline`. | [1]https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy<br>[2]https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy#unsafe-inline<br>[3]https://github.com/payloadbox/xss-payload-list<br>[4]https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/commit/da8f94342a84cff9d78c98bcc3b3604ee2e577d2<br>[5]https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/security/advisories/GHSA-9p57-h987-4vgx<br>[6]https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex |
| 16 | CVE-2024-4192 | 7.8  | HIGH | Delta Electronics CNCSoft-G2 lacks proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. | [1]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-121-01 |
