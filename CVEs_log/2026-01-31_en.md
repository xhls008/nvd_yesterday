| 25 | CVE-2026-25130 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | Cybersecurity AI (CAI) is a framework for AI Security. In versions up to and including 0.5.10, the CAI (Cybersecurity AI) framework contains multiple argument injection vulnerabilities in its function tools. User-controlled input is passed directly to shell commands via `subprocess.Popen()` with `shell=True`, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the host system. The `find_file()` tool executes without requiring user approval because find is considered a "safe" pre-approved command. This means an attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by injecting malicious arguments (like -exec) into the args parameter, completely bypassing any human-in-the-loop safety mechanisms. Commit e22a1220f764e2d7cf9da6d6144926f53ca01cde contains a fix. | [1]https://github.com/aliasrobotics/cai/blob/559de8fcbc2b44f3b0360f35ffdc2bb975e7d7e4/src/cai/tools/reconnaissance/filesystem.py#L60<br>[2]https://github.com/aliasrobotics/cai/commit/e22a1220f764e2d7cf9da6d6144926f53ca01cde<br>[3]https://github.com/aliasrobotics/cai/security/advisories/GHSA-jfpc-wj3m-qw2m |
| 26 | CVE-2025-36184 | 7.2  | HIGH | IBM Db2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows (includes Db2 Connect Server) 11.5.0 - 11.5.9 could allow an instance owner to execute malicious code that escalate their privileges to root due to execution of unnecessary privileges operated at a higher than minimum level. | [1]https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/7257519 |

| 28 | CVE-2026-25153 | 7.7  | HIGH | Backstage is an open framework for building developer portals, and @backstage/plugin-techdocs-node provides common node.js functionalities for TechDocs. In versions of @backstage/plugin-techdocs-node prior to 1.13.11 and 1.14.1, when TechDocs is configured with `runIn: local`, a malicious actor who can submit or modify a repository`s `mkdocs.yml` file can execute arbitrary Python code on the TechDocs build server via MkDocs hooks configuration. @backstage/plugin-techdocs-node versions 1.13.11 and 1.14.1 contain a fix. The fix introduces an allowlist of supported MkDocs configuration keys. Unsupported configuration keys (including `hooks`) are now removed from `mkdocs.yml` before running the generator, with a warning logged to indicate which keys were removed. Users of `@techdocs/cli` should also upgrade to the latest version, which includes the fixed `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-node` dependency. Some workarounds are available. Configure TechDocs with `runIn: docker` instead of `runIn: local` to provide container isolation, though it does not fully mitigate the risk. Limit who can modify `mkdocs.yml` files in repositories that TechDocs processes; only allow trusted contributors. Implement PR review requirements for changes to `mkdocs.yml` files to detect malicious `hooks` configurations before they are merged. Use MkDocs < 1.4.0 (e.g., 1.3.1) which does not support hooks. Note: This may limit access to newer MkDocs features. Building documentation in CI/CD pipelines using `@techdocs/cli` does not mitigate this vulnerability, as the CLI uses the same vulnerable `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-node` package. | [1]https://github.com/backstage/backstage/security/advisories/GHSA-6jr7-99pf-8vgf |

For example, requesting /static/css//../../../../../../../../etc/passwd returns the contents of /etc/passwd. This vulnerability was discovered by Raif Berkay Dincel and confirmed on Linux Mint and Windows 10. | [1]https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti<br>[2]https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48595<br>[3]https://www.opencti.io/<br>[4]https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/opencti-directory-traversal |

| 55 | CVE-2026-25156 | 7.3  | HIGH | HotCRP is conference review software. HotCRP versions from October 2025 through January 2026 delivered documents of all types with inline Content-Disposition, causing them to be rendered in the user’s browser rather than downloaded. (The intended behavior was for only `text/plain`, `application/pdf`, `image/gif`, `image/jpeg`, and `image/png` to be delivered inline, though adding `save=0` to the document URL could request inline delivery for any document.) This made users who clicked a document link vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks. An uploaded HTML or SVG document would run in the viewer’s browser with access to their HotCRP credentials, and Javascript in that document could eventually make arbitrary calls to HotCRP’s API. Malicious documents could be uploaded to submission fields with “file upload” or “attachment” type, or as attachments to comments. PDF upload fields were not vulnerable. A search of documents uploaded to hotcrp.com found no evidence of exploitation. The vulnerability was introduced in commit aa20ef288828b04550950cf67c831af8a525f508 (11 October 2025), present in development versions and v3.2, and fixed in commit 8933e86c9f384b356dc4c6e9e2814dee1074b323 and v3.2.1. Additionally, c3d88a7e18d52119c65df31c2cc994edd2beccc5 and v3.2.1 remove support for `save=0`. | [1]https://github.com/kohler/hotcrp/commit/8933e86c9f384b356dc4c6e9e2814dee1074b323<br>[2]https://github.com/kohler/hotcrp/commit/aa20ef288828b04550950cf67c831af8a525f508<br>[3]https://github.com/kohler/hotcrp/commit/c3d88a7e18d52119c65df31c2cc994edd2beccc5<br>[4]https://github.com/kohler/hotcrp/security/advisories/GHSA-p88p-2f2p-2476 |
