|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2024-10587 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Interactive Contact Form and Multi Step Form Builder with Drag & Drop Editor – Funnelforms Free plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.7.4.1 via deserialization of untrusted input. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. | [1]https://wordpress.org/plugins/funnelforms-free/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/701e6afe-08fa-49c7-a6da-cb266db07c48?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2024-10952 | 7.3  | HIGH | The The Authors List plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution via update_authors_list_ajax AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.4.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/authors-list/tags/2.0.4/backend/includes/class-authors-list-item.php#L843<br>[2]https://wordpress.org/plugins/authors-list/#developers<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/8b3cfe0a-dcfb-40f3-ba43-4e838c113010?source=cve<br>[4]https://www.wpkube.com/ |

| 4 | CVE-2024-54664 | 7.8  | HIGH | An issue was discovered in Veritas NetBackup before 10.5. This only applies to NetBackup components running on a Windows Operating System. If a user executes specific NetBackup commands or an attacker uses social engineering techniques to impel the user to execute the commands, a malicious DLL could be loaded, resulting in execution of the attacker`s code in the user`s security context, a different vulnerability than CVE-2024-52945. | [1]https://www.veritas.com/content/support/en_US/security/VTS24-012 |
| 5 | CVE-2024-11398 | 8.1  | HIGH | Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory (`Path Traversal`) vulnerability in OTP reset functionality in Synology Router Manager (SRM) before 1.3.1-9346-9 allows remote authenticated users to delete arbitrary files via unspecified vectors. | [1]https://www.synology.com/en-global/security/advisory/Synology_SA_24_03 |

| 7 | CVE-2024-11293 | 8.1  | HIGH | The  Registration Forms – User Registration Forms, Invitation-Based Registrations, Front-end User Profile, Login Form & Content Restriction Social Sites Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.9. This is due to insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the email and the user does not have an already-existing account for the service returning the token. | [1]https://pieregister.com/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/466ff226-a47e-46f1-a46c-6260208ffd42?source=cve |

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, and permissions granted by an Administrator, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included. The vulnerability is limited to PHP files in a Windows environment. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/classic-addons-wpbakery-page-builder-addons/tags/3.1/addons/testimonial-slider-item/testimonial-slider-item.php#L28<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/9645b17e-6a7c-4cdd-ae43-7d2c84b624cc?source=cve |

| 13 | CVE-2024-11643 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Accessibility by AllAccessible plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the `AllAccessible_save_settings` function in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/allaccessible/trunk/allaccessible.php#L249<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3202017/<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/bb65d916-7d9e-4562-ab9b-c7ba012a08fb?source=cve |
