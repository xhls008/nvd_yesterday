| 1 | CVE-2024-12171 | 8.8  | HIGH | The ELEX WordPress HelpDesk & Customer Ticketing System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the `eh_crm_agent_add_user` AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to create new administrative user accounts. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3227859/elex-helpdesk-customer-support-ticket-system/trunk/includes/class-crm-ajax-functions-one.php<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3213791%40elex-helpdesk-customer-support-ticket-system&new=3213791%40elex-helpdesk-customer-support-ticket-system&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/cbcd978b-e81f-4c39-b2f7-adc948d21b1b?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2024-13343 | 8.8  | HIGH | The WooCommerce Customers Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to a missing capability check on the ajax_assign_new_roles() function in all versions up to, and including, 31.3.

| 3 | CVE-2024-51534 | 7.1  | HIGH | Dell PowerProtect DD versions prior to DDOS 8.3.0.0, 7.10.1.50, and 7.13.1.20 contain a path traversal vulnerability. A local low privileged could potentially exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized overwrite of OS files stored on the server filesystem. Exploitation could lead to denial of service. | [1]https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000279157/dsa-2025-022-security-update-for-dell-powerprotect-dd-multiple-vulnerabilities |
| 4 | CVE-2024-53295 | 7.8  | HIGH | Dell PowerProtect DD versions prior to 8.3.0.0, 7.10.1.50, and 7.13.1.20 contain an improper access control vulnerability. A local malicious user with low privileges could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to escalation of privilege. | [1]https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000279157/dsa-2025-022-security-update-for-dell-powerprotect-dd-multiple-vulnerabilities |
| 5 | CVE-2025-0366 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Jupiter X Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 4.8.7 via the get_svg() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution. In this specific case,  an attacker can create a form that allows SVG uploads, upload an SVG file with malicious content and then include the SVG file in a post to achieve remote code execution. This means it is relatively easy to gain remote code execution as a contributor-level user and above by default. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3231122/jupiterx-core/trunk/includes/extensions/raven/includes/modules/forms/classes/ajax-handler.php<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3231122/jupiterx-core/trunk/includes/extensions/raven/includes/modules/video/widgets/video.php<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/1a20dc1d-eb7c-47ac-ad9a-ec4c0d5db62e?source=cve |
