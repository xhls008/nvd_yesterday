| 12 | CVE-2025-68472 | 8.1  | HIGH | MindsDB is a platform for building artificial intelligence from enterprise data. Prior to version 25.11.1, an unauthenticated path traversal in the file upload API lets any caller read arbitrary files from the server filesystem and move them into MindsDB’s storage, exposing sensitive data. The PUT handler in file.py directly joins user-controlled data into a filesystem path when the request body is JSON and source_type is not "url". Only multipart uploads and URL-sourced uploads receive sanitization; JSON uploads lack any call to clear_filename or equivalent checks. This vulnerability is fixed in 25.11.1. | [1]https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/security/advisories/GHSA-qqhf-pm3j-96g7 |
| 13 | CVE-2026-22252 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | LibreChat is a ChatGPT clone with additional features. Prior to v0.8.2-rc2, LibreChat`s MCP stdio transport accepts arbitrary commands without validation, allowing any authenticated user to execute shell commands as root inside the container through a single API request. This vulnerability is fixed in v0.8.2-rc2. | [1]https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/commit/211b39f3113d4e6ecab84be0a83f4e9c9dea127f<br>[2]https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/security/advisories/GHSA-cxhj-j78r-p88f |
| 14 | CVE-2026-22771 | 8.8  | HIGH | Envoy Gateway is an open source project for managing Envoy Proxy as a standalone or Kubernetes-based application gateway. Prior to 1.5.7 and 1.6.2, EnvoyExtensionPolicy Lua scripts executed by Envoy proxy can be used to leak the proxy`s credentials. These credentials can then be used to communicate with the control plane and gain access to all secrets that are used by Envoy proxy, e.g. TLS private keys and credentials used for downstream and upstream communication. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.5.7 and 1.6.2. | [1]https://github.com/envoyproxy/gateway/security/advisories/GHSA-xrwg-mqj6-6m22 |
| 15 | CVE-2026-22783 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | Iris is a web collaborative platform that helps incident responders share technical details during investigations. Prior to 2.4.24, the DFIR-IRIS datastore file management system has a vulnerability where mass assignment of the file_local_name field combined with path trust in the delete operation enables authenticated users to delete arbitrary filesystem paths. The vulnerability manifests through a three-step attack chain: authenticated users upload a file to the datastore, update the file`s file_local_name field to point to an arbitrary filesystem path through mass assignment, then trigger the delete operation which removes the target file without path validation. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.4.24. | [1]https://github.com/dfir-iris/iris-web/commit/57c1b80494bac187893aebc6d9df1ce6e56485b7<br>[2]https://github.com/dfir-iris/iris-web/security/advisories/GHSA-qhqj-8qw6-wp8v |

| 19 | CVE-2025-67147 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities exist in amansuryawanshi Gym-Management-System-PHP 1.0 via the `name`, `email`, and `comment` parameters in (1) submit_contact.php, the `username` and `pass_key` parameters in (2) secure_login.php, and the `login_id`, `pwfield`, and `login_key` parameters in (3) change_s_pwd.php. An unauthenticated or authenticated attacker can exploit these issues to bypass authentication, execute arbitrary SQL commands, modify database records, delete data, or escalate privileges to administrator level. | [1]https://github.com/amansuryawanshi/Gym-Management-System-PHP/issues/3 |
| 20 | CVE-2025-67146 | 9.4  | CRITICAL | Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities exist in AbhishekMali21 GYM-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM 1.0 via the `name` parameter in (1) member_search.php, (2) trainer_search.php, and (3) gym_search.php, and via the `id` parameter in (4) payment_search.php. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit these issues to inject malicious SQL commands, leading to unauthorized data extraction, authentication bypass, or modification of database contents. | [1]https://github.com/AbhishekMali21/GYM-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM/issues/4 |
| 21 | CVE-2026-22788 | 8.2  | HIGH | WebErpMesv2 is a Resource Management and Manufacturing execution system Web for industry. Prior to 1.19, the WebErpMesV2 application exposes multiple sensitive API endpoints without authentication middleware. An unauthenticated remote attacker can read business-critical data including companies, quotes, orders, tasks, and whiteboards. Limited write access allows creation of company records and full manipulation of collaboration whiteboards. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.19. | [1]https://github.com/SMEWebify/WebErpMesv2/commit/3a7ab1c95d1d1c8f7c62c84bc87b3666ecd2fa23<br>[2]https://github.com/SMEWebify/WebErpMesv2/security/advisories/GHSA-pp68-5pc2-hv7w |
| 22 | CVE-2026-22794 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | Appsmith is a platform to build admin panels, internal tools, and dashboards. Prior to 1.93, the server uses the Origin value from the request headers as the email link baseUrl without validation. If an attacker controls the Origin, password reset / email verification links in emails can be generated pointing to the attacker’s domain, causing authentication tokens to be exposed and potentially leading to account takeover. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.93. | [1]https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/commit/6f9ee6226bac13fb4b836940b557913fff78b633<br>[2]https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/security/advisories/GHSA-7hf5-mc28-xmcv |
| 23 | CVE-2026-22804 | 8.0  | HIGH | Termix is a web-based server management platform with SSH terminal, tunneling, and file editing capabilities. From 1.7.0 to 1.9.0, Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Termix File Manager component. The application fails to sanitize SVG file content before rendering it. This allows an attacker who has compromised a managed SSH server to plant a malicious file, which, when previewed by the Termix user, executes arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the application. The vulnerability is located in src/ui/desktop/apps/file-manager/components/FileViewer.tsx. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.10.0. | [1]https://github.com/Termix-SSH/Termix/security/advisories/GHSA-m3cv-5hgp-hv35 |
