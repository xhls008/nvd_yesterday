|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2024-5150 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Login with phone number plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.7.26. This is due to the `activation_code` default value is empty, and the not empty check is missing in the `lwp_ajax_register` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the user email. The vulnerability is patched in version 1.7.26, but there is an issue in the patch that causes the entire function to not work, and this issue is fixed in version 1.7.27. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/login-with-phone-number/tags/1.7.25/login-with-phonenumber.php#L4183<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/login-with-phone-number/tags/1.7.25/login-with-phonenumber.php#L4220<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/login-with-phone-number/tags/1.7.25/login-with-phonenumber.php#L4241<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3090625/login-with-phone-number<br>[5]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3090754/login-with-phone-number#file5<br>[6]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/cf34eb9f-f6e9-4a7a-8459-c86f9fa3dad8?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2024-5204 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Swiss Toolkit For WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.0.7. This is due to the plugin storing custom data in post metadata without an underscore prefix. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/swiss-toolkit-for-wp/trunk/includes/plugins/class-boomdevs-swiss-toolkit-generate-login-url.php?rev=3077000#L50<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3091913/swiss-toolkit-for-wp<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/a8526106-847a-420f-9275-f759a8dd4dfb?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2023-6743 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Unlimited Elements For Elementor (Free Widgets, Addons, Templates) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.89 via the template import functionality. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and above, to execute code on the server. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/unlimited-elements-for-elementor/trunk/inc_php/unitecreator_output.class.php#L1765<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/unlimited-elements-for-elementor/trunk/provider/core/plugins/unlimited_elements/elementor/elementor_widget.class.php#L3948<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3010986/unlimited-elements-for-elementor#file6<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3015166/unlimited-elements-for-elementor<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/25f71a19-85b1-4bc9-b193-d9de2eba81ee?source=cve |

| 5 | CVE-2024-4611 | 8.1  | HIGH | The AppPresser plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to improper missing encryption exception handling on the `decrypt_value` and on the `doCookieAuth` functions in all versions up to, and including, 4.3.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they previously used the login via the plugin API. This can only be exploited if the `openssl` php extension is not loaded on the server. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/apppresser/trunk/inc/AppPresser_Theme_Switcher.php?rev=2456516#L133<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/apppresser/trunk/inc/AppPresser_Theme_Switcher.php?rev=2456516#L167<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/apppresser/trunk/inc/AppPresser_User.php?rev=2789173#L40<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3093975/apppresser<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d1498fdf-9d5e-4277-92be-469d6646864b?source=cve |
| 6 | CVE-2024-3412 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | The WP STAGING WordPress Backup Plugin – Migration Backup Restore plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the wpstg_processing AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.3.

| 9 | CVE-2024-5185 | 7.3  | HIGH | The EmbedAI application is susceptible to security issues that enable Data Poisoning attacks. This weakness could result in the application becoming compromised, leading to unauthorized entries or data poisoning attacks, which are delivered by a CSRF vulnerability due to the absence of a secure session management implementation and weak CORS policies weakness. An attacker can direct a user to a malicious webpage that exploits a CSRF vulnerability within the EmbedAI application. By leveraging this CSRF vulnerability, the attacker can deceive the user into inadvertently uploading and integrating incorrect data into the application’s language model. | [1]https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/cyrc-advisory-data-poisoning-embedai.html |
| 10 | CVE-2024-36470 | 8.1  | HIGH | In JetBrains TeamCity before 2022.04.6, 2022.10.5, 2023.05.5, 2023.11.5 authentication bypass was possible in specific edge cases | [1]https://www.jetbrains.com/privacy-security/issues-fixed/ |

| 13 | CVE-2024-36114 | 8.6  | HIGH | Aircompressor is a library with ports of the Snappy, LZO, LZ4, and Zstandard compression algorithms to Java. All decompressor implementations of Aircompressor (LZ4, LZO, Snappy, Zstandard) can crash the JVM for certain input, and in some cases also leak the content of other memory of the Java process (which could contain sensitive information). When decompressing certain data, the decompressors try to access memory outside the bounds of the given byte arrays or byte buffers. Because Aircompressor uses the JDK class `sun.misc.Unsafe` to speed up memory access, no additional bounds checks are performed and this has similar security consequences as out-of-bounds access in C or C++, namely it can lead to non-deterministic behavior or crash the JVM. Users should update to Aircompressor 0.27 or newer where these issues have been fixed. When decompressing data from untrusted users, this can be exploited for a denial-of-service attack by crashing the JVM, or to leak other sensitive information from the Java process. There are no known workarounds for this issue. | [1]https://github.com/airlift/aircompressor/commit/15e68df9eb0c2bfde7f796231ee7cd1982965071<br>[2]https://github.com/airlift/aircompressor/commit/2cea90a45534f9aacbb77426fb64e975504dee6e<br>[3]https://github.com/airlift/aircompressor/commit/cf66151541edb062ea88b6f3baab3f95e48b7b7f<br>[4]https://github.com/airlift/aircompressor/commit/d01ecb779375a092d00e224abe7869cdf49ddc3e<br>[5]https://github.com/airlift/aircompressor/security/advisories/GHSA-973x-65j7-xcf4 |
