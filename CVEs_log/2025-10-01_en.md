| 2 | CVE-2025-11149 | 7.5  | HIGH | This affects all versions of the package node-static; all versions of the package @nubosoftware/node-static. The package fails to catch an exception when user input includes null bytes. This allows attackers to access http://host/%00 and crash the server. | [1]https://github.com/cloudhead/node-static/commit/78879dc665f0f7137063794b6e0b6203a81c7f67<br>[2]https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-NODESTATIC-1297183<br>[3]https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-NUBOSOFTWARENODESTATIC-3330728 |
| 3 | CVE-2025-7038 | 8.2  | HIGH | The LatePoint plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass due to insufficient identity verification within the steps__load_step route of the latepoint_route_call AJAX endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.94. The endpoint reads the client-supplied customer email and related customer fields before invoking the internal login handler without verifying login status, capability checks, or a valid AJAX nonce. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log into any customer’s account. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/latepoint/tags/5.1.93/latepoint.php<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/latepoint/tags/5.1.93/lib/controllers/steps_controller.php<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3366851%40latepoint&new=3366851%40latepoint&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[4]https://wordpress.org/plugins/latepoint/#developers<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d7389e17-a357-481a-8716-3a93cb6afa7c?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2025-7052 | 8.8  | HIGH | The LatePoint plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.94. This is due to missing nonce validation on the change_password() function of its customer_cabinet__change_password AJAX route. The plugin hooks this endpoint via wp_ajax and wp_ajax_nopriv but does not verify a nonce or user capability before resetting the user’s password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers who trick a logged-in customer (or, with “WP users as customers” enabled, an administrator) into visiting a malicious link to take over their account. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/latepoint/tags/5.1.93/latepoint.php<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/latepoint/tags/5.1.93/lib/controllers/customer_cabinet_controller.php#L403<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3366851/latepoint/tags/5.2.0/lib/controllers/customer_cabinet_controller.php<br>[4]https://wordpress.org/plugins/latepoint/#developers<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/df8a8ce0-7258-40ae-bf73-f8c6185fdd16?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2025-8625 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Copypress Rest API plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via copyreap_handle_image() Function in versions 1.1 to 1.2. The plugin falls back to a hard-coded JWT signing key when no secret is defined and does not restrict which file types can be fetched and saved as attachments. As a result, unauthenticated attackers can forge a valid token to gain elevated privileges and upload an arbitrary file (e.g. a PHP script) through the image handler, leading to remote code execution. | [1]https://wordpress.org/plugins/copypress-rest-api/#developers<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/3045c9e5-4095-48e5-8d9d-16a091e69d54?source=cve |
| 6 | CVE-2025-8877 | 7.5  | HIGH | The AffiliateWP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the ajax_get_affiliate_id_from_login function in all versions up to, and including, 2.28.2 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://affiliatewp.com<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/5ae32a38-5be3-47d0-9c56-2fcda7662c71?source=cve |
| 7 | CVE-2025-9762 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Post By Email plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the save_attachments function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.4b. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/post-by-email/tags/1.0.4b/class-post-by-email.php#L702<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/885eb923-8e69-416b-8494-a42a9465cfe0?source=cve |
| 8 | CVE-2025-9991 | 8.1  | HIGH | The Tiny Bootstrap Elements Light plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 4.3.34 via the `language` parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary .php files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where .php file types can be uploaded and included. | [1]https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/tiny-bootstrap-elements-light/trunk/assets/bootstrap-label.php<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tiny-bootstrap-elements-light/trunk/assets/bootstrap-label.php#L14<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c1010470-63d4-49c5-9811-0e86fbeb57d5?source=cve |
| 9 | CVE-2025-9993 | 8.1  | HIGH | The Bei Fen – WordPress Backup Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.2 via the `task`. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary .php files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where .php file types can be uploaded and included. This only affects instances running PHP 7.1 or older. | [1]https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/bei-fen/trunk/beifen.php<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/bei-fen/trunk/beifen.php#L185<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/839c3b99-189d-4a74-b295-d44eb39d86c8?source=cve |
| 10 | CVE-2025-9230 | 7.5  | HIGH | Issue summary: An application trying to decrypt CMS messages encrypted usingpassword based encryption can trigger an out-of-bounds read and write.Impact summary: This out-of-bounds read may trigger a crash which leads toDenial of Service for an application. The out-of-bounds write can causea memory corruption which can have various consequences includinga Denial of Service or Execution of attacker-supplied code.Although the consequences of a successful exploit of this vulnerabilitycould be severe, the probability that the attacker would be able toperform it is low. Besides, password based (PWRI) encryption support in CMSmessages is very rarely used. For that reason the issue was assessed asModerate severity according to our Security Policy.The FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by thisissue, as the CMS implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS moduleboundary. | [1]https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/5965ea5dd6960f36d8b7f74f8eac67a8eb8f2b45<br>[2]https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/9e91358f365dee6c446dcdcdb01c04d2743fd280<br>[3]https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/a79c4ce559c6a3a8fd4109e9f33c1185d5bf2def<br>[4]https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/b5282d677551afda7d20e9c00e09561b547b2dfd<br>[5]https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/bae259a211ada6315dc50900686daaaaaa55f482<br>[6]https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/c2b96348bfa662f25f4fabf81958ae822063dae3<br>[7]https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/dfbaf161d8dafc1132dd88cd48ad990ed9b4c8ba<br>[8]https://openssl-library.org/news/secadv/20250930.txt |
| 11 | CVE-2025-7493 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | A privilege escalation flaw from host to domain administrator was found in FreeIPA. This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2025-4404, where it fails to validate the uniqueness of the krbCanonicalName. While the previously released version added validations for the admin@REALM credential, FreeIPA still does not validate the root@REALM canonical name, which can also be used as the realm administrator`s name. This flaw allows an attacker to perform administrative tasks over the REALM, leading to access to sensitive data and sensitive data exfiltration. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:17084<br>[2]https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:17085<br>[3]https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:17086<br>[4]https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:17087<br>[5]https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:17088<br>[6]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-7493<br>[7]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2389448 |
