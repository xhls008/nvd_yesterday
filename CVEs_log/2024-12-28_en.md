| 9 | CVE-2024-56508 | 7.6  | HIGH | LinkAce is a self-hosted archive to collect links of your favorite websites. Prior to 1.15.6, a file upload vulnerability exists in the LinkAce. This issue occurs in the "Import Bookmarks" functionality, where malicious HTML files can be uploaded containing JavaScript payloads. These payloads execute when the uploaded links are accessed, leading to potential reflected or persistent XSS scenarios. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.15.6. | [1]https://github.com/Kovah/LinkAce/commit/8cf3670d71a8629d33408da76f9d441a1aa933f6<br>[2]https://github.com/Kovah/LinkAce/security/advisories/GHSA-2wvv-4576-8862<br>[3]https://github.com/Kovah/LinkAce/security/advisories/GHSA-2wvv-4576-8862 |
| 10 | CVE-2024-56509 | 8.6  | HIGH | changedetection.io is a free open source web page change detection, website watcher, restock monitor and notification service. Improper input validation in the application can allow attackers to perform local file read (LFR) or path traversal attacks. These vulnerabilities occur when user input is used to construct file paths without adequate sanitization or validation. For example, using file:../../../etc/passwd or file: ///etc/passwd can bypass weak validations and allow unauthorized access to sensitive files. Even though this has been addressed in previous patch, it is still insufficient. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.48.05. | [1]https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/commit/f7e9846c9b40a229813d19cdb66bf60fbe5e6a2a<br>[2]https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/security/advisories/GHSA-j5vv-6wjg-cfr8<br>[3]https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/security/advisories/GHSA-j5vv-6wjg-cfr8 |
