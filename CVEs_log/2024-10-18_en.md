| 1 | CVE-2024-45766 | 8.0  | HIGH | Dell OpenManage Enterprise, version(s) OME 4.1 and prior, contain(s) an Improper Control of Generation of Code (`Code Injection`) vulnerability. A low privileged attacker with remote access could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to Code execution. | [1]https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000237300/dsa-2024-426-security-update-for-dell-openmanage-enterprise-vulnerabilities |
| 2 | CVE-2024-9215 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Co-Authors, Multiple Authors and Guest Authors in an Author Box with PublishPress Authors plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference to Privilege Escalation/Account Takeover in all versions up to, and including, 4.7.1 via the action_edited_author() due to missing validation on the `authors-user_id` user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to update arbitrary user accounts email addresses, including administrators, which can then be leveraged to reset that user`s account password and gain access. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/publishpress-authors/tags/4.7.1/src/core/Classes/Author_Editor.php#L594<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3169244%40publishpress-authors&new=3169244%40publishpress-authors&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=#file7<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d0506137-82e3-4988-9b23-370465a866c0?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2024-9861 | 8.1  | HIGH | The Miniorange OTP Verification with Firebase plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 3.6.0. This is due to missing validation on the token being supplied during the otp login through the plugin. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they know the phone number associated with that user. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/miniorange-firebase-sms-otp-verification/tags/3.6.0/handler/forms/class-loginform.php#L144<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/miniorange-firebase-sms-otp-verification/tags/3.6.0/handler/forms/class-loginform.php#L190<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3169869/miniorange-firebase-sms-otp-verification#file3<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/04045ec3-dd8e-4ac5-bd73-eef6205ecc62?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2024-9862 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Miniorange OTP Verification with Firebase plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary User Password Change in versions up to, and including, 3.6.0. This is due to the plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization and access system resources, and the user current password check is missing. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/miniorange-firebase-sms-otp-verification/tags/3.6.0/handler/forms/class-loginform.php#L236<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3169869/miniorange-firebase-sms-otp-verification#file3<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/9c3df12d-e526-4a23-89d3-bfdcea9f7b2d?source=cve |
