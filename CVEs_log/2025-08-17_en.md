| 1 | CVE-2025-49895 | 8.8  | HIGH | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in iThemes ServerBuddy by PluginBuddy.Com allows Object Injection.This issue affects ServerBuddy by PluginBuddy.Com: from n/a through 1.0.5. | [1]https://patchstack.com/database/wordpress/plugin/serverbuddy-by-pluginbuddy/vulnerability/wordpress-serverbuddy-by-pluginbuddy-com-plugin-1-0-5-csrf-to-php-object-injection-vulnerability?_s_id=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2024-12612 | 7.5  | HIGH | The School Management System for Wordpress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via several parameters across multiple AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 93.2.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://codecanyon.net/item/school-management-system-for-wordpress/11470032<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/258877a7-670c-4a3c-8107-47dc7ba6a5ed?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2025-3671 | 8.8  | HIGH | The WPGYM - Wordpress Gym Management System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 67.7.0 via the `page` parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included. The Local File Inclusion exploit can be chained to include various dashboard view files in the plugin. One in particular reported by the researcher can be leveraged to update the password of Super Administrator accounts in Multisite environments making privilege escalation possible. | [1]https://codecanyon.net/item/-wpgym-wordpress-gym-management-system/13352964<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6536d19f-a042-4404-b0c9-91aacd7768f7?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2025-6079 | 8.8  | HIGH | The School Management System for Wordpress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the homework.php file in all versions up to, and including, 93.2.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Student-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://codecanyon.net/item/school-management-system-for-wordpress/11470032<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d872ec33-6284-495c-b894-41fe7b40b63c?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2025-6080 | 8.8  | HIGH | The WPGYM - Wordpress Gym Management System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized admin account creation in all versions up to, and including, 67.7.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user`s capabilities prior to adding users. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to create new users, including admins. | [1]https://codecanyon.net/item/-wpgym-wordpress-gym-management-system/13352964<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6f853657-1801-4d63-89b8-b2132212a205?source=cve |
| 6 | CVE-2025-7441 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The StoryChief plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.42. This vulnerability occurs through the /wp-json/storychief/webhook REST-API endpoint that does not have sufficient filetype validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/story-chief/trunk/includes/tools.php#L75<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/979efaa4-10f1-4c7f-b4b0-5a41678c9d66?source=cve |
| 7 | CVE-2025-7664 | 7.5  | HIGH | The AL Pack plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on the check_activate_permission() permission callback for the /wp-json/presslearn/v1/activate REST API endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2. The callback reads the client-supplied Origin header and, after parsing, allows the request if it matches one of the trusted domains, without ever verifying user authentication, capabilities, or nonce tokens. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to activate premium features by simply spoofing the Origin header. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/alpack/trunk/includes/api.php<br>[2]https://wordpress.org/plugins/alpack/#developers<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/793a2096-3332-412e-a45a-a7367b1209a3?source=cve |
| 8 | CVE-2025-8898 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Taxi Booking Manager for Woocommerce | E-cab plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user`s capabilities prior to updating a plugin setting or their identity prior to updating their details like email address. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user`s email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user`s password and gain access to their account. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3343878/ecab-taxi-booking-manager/trunk/inc/MPTBM_Rest_Api.php<br>[2]https://wordpress.org/plugins/ecab-taxi-booking-manager/<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/fd50ac2c-3049-4a44-b7f8-a5f87c42555c?source=cve |
| 9 | CVE-2025-8105 | 7.3  | HIGH | The The Soledad theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 8.6.7. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/soledad-multiconcept-blogmagazine-wp-theme/12945398#item-description__update-changelog<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/a6c842bb-914a-47c1-aaac-e748f58e12ef?source=cve |
| 10 | CVE-2025-8142 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Soledad theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 8.6.7 via the `header_layout` parameter.
