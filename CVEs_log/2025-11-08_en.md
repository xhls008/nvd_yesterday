| 1 | CVE-2025-5483 | 8.1  | HIGH | The LC Wizard plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to a missing capability check in the ghl-wizard/inc/wp_user.php file in versions 1.2.10 to 1.3.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create new user accounts with the administrator role when the PRO functionality is enabled. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3366906<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/42dcc302-b543-42c7-99fa-605f017beb1a?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2025-64180 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | Manager-io/Manager is accounting software. In Manager Desktop and Server versions 25.11.1.3085 and below, a critical vulnerability permits unauthorized access to internal network resources. The flaw lies in the fundamental design of the DNS validation mechanism. A Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) condition that allows attackers to bypass network isolation and access internal services, cloud metadata endpoints, and protected network segments. The Desktop edition requires no authentication; the Server edition requires only standard authentication. This issue is fixed in version 25.11.1.3086. | [1]https://github.com/Manager-io/Manager/security/advisories/GHSA-j2xj-xhph-p74j |
| 3 | CVE-2025-64184 | 8.8  | HIGH | Dosage is a comic strip downloader and archiver. When downloading comic images in versions 3.1 and below, Dosage constructs target file names from different aspects of the remote comic (page URL, image URL, page content, etc.). While the basename is properly stripped of directory-traversing characters, the file extension is taken from the HTTP Content-Type header. This allows a remote attacker (or a Man-in-the-Middle, if the comic is served over HTTP) to write arbitrary files outside the target directory (if additional conditions are met). This issue is fixed in version 3.2. | [1]https://github.com/webcomics/dosage/commit/336a9684191604bc49eed7296b74bd582151181e<br>[2]https://github.com/webcomics/dosage/security/advisories/GHSA-4vcx-3pj3-44m7 |
| 4 | CVE-2025-12352 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Gravity Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the copy_post_image() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.20. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. This only impacts sites that have allow_url_fopen set to `On`, the post creation form enabled along with a file upload field for the post | [1]https://github.com/pronamic/gravityforms/blob/06de1b7e169e4f073e9d0d491e17b89365b48c20/forms_model.php#L5451C26-L5451C41<br>[2]https://github.com/pronamic/gravityforms/blob/06de1b7e169e4f073e9d0d491e17b89365b48c20/includes/fields/class-gf-field-fileupload.php#L306<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/42525101-6196-40b9-90e7-c7f1886ef247?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2025-4519 | 8.8  | HIGH | The IDonate – Blood Donation, Request And Donor Management System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to a missing capability check on the idonate_donor_password() function in versions 2.1.5 to 2.1.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to initiate a password reset for any user (including administrators) and elevate their privileges for full site takeover. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/idonate/tags/2.1.9/src/Helpers/DonorFunctions.php#L410<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3334424/idonate/tags/2.1.10/src/Helpers/DonorFunctions.php?old=3279142&old_path=idonate%2Ftags%2F2.1.9%2Fsrc%2FHelpers%2FDonorFunctions.php<br>[3]https://wordpress.org/plugins/idonate/#developers<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/596aef67-582a-4506-bae9-c7be1899e47a?source=cve |
| 6 | CVE-2025-64343 | 7.8  | HIGH | (conda) Constructor is a tool that enables users to create installers for conda package collections. In versions 3.12.2 and below, the  installation directory inherits permissions from its parent directory. Outside of restricted directories, the permissions are very permissive and often allow write access by authenticated users. Any logged in user can make modifications during the installation for both single-user and all-user installations. This constitutes a local attack vector if the installation is in a directory local users have access to. For single-user installations in a shared directory, these permissions persist after the installation. This issue is fixed in version 3.13.0. | [1]https://github.com/conda/constructor/commit/c368383710a7c2b81ad1b0ecb9724b38d3577447<br>[2]https://github.com/conda/constructor/releases/tag/3.13.0<br>[3]https://github.com/conda/constructor/security/advisories/GHSA-vvpr-2qg4-2mrq |

| 9 | CVE-2025-63690 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | In pig-mesh Pig versions 3.8.2 and below, when setting up scheduled tasks in the Quartz management function under the system management module, it is possible to execute any Java class with a parameterless constructor and its methods with parameter type String through reflection. At this time, the eval method in Tomcat`s built-in class jakarta.el.ELProcessor can be used to execute commands, leading to a remote code execution vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/LockeTom/vulnerability/blob/main/md/pig_Remote_Code_Execution_Vulnerability.md<br>[2]https://github.com/pig-mesh/pig/issues/1199 |
| 10 | CVE-2025-63691 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | In pig-mesh In Pig version 3.8.2 and below, within the Token Management function under the System Management module, the token query interface (/api/admin/sys-token/page) has an improper permission verification issue, which leads to information leakage. This interface can be called by any user who has completed login authentication, and it returns the plaintext authentication Tokens of all users currently logged in to the system. As a result, ordinary users can obtain the administrator`s authentication Token through this interface, thereby forging an administrator account, gaining the system`s management permissions, and taking over the system. | [1]https://github.com/LockeTom/vulnerability/blob/main/md/pig_Information_disclosure_vulnerability.md<br>[2]https://github.com/pig-mesh/pig/issues/1202 |
| 11 | CVE-2025-64347 | 7.5  | HIGH | Apollo Router Core is a configurable Rust graph router written to run a federated supergraph using Apollo Federation 2. Versions 1.61.12-rc.0 and below and 2.8.1-rc.0 allow unauthorized access to protected data through schema elements with access control directives (@authenticated, @requiresScopes, and @policy) that were renamed via @link imports. Router did not enforce renamed access control directives on schema elements (e.g. fields and types), allowing queries to bypass those element-level access controls. This issue is fixed in versions 1.61.12 and 2.8.1. | [1]https://github.com/apollographql/router/commit/78e4b20a2fc26cc5f141aa47992ed85375266a2b<br>[2]https://github.com/apollographql/router/security/advisories/GHSA-g8jh-vg5j-4h3f |
| 12 | CVE-2025-64430 | 7.5  | HIGH | Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. In versions 4.2.0 through 7.5.3, and 8.0.0 through 8.3.1-alpha.1, there is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the file upload functionality when trying to upload a Parse.File with uri parameter, allowing execution of an arbitrary URI. The vulnerability stems from a file upload feature in which Parse Server retrieves the file data from a URI that is provided in the request. A request to the provided URI is executed, but the response is not stored in Parse Server`s file storage as the server crashes upon receiving the response. This issue is fixed in versions 7.5.4 and 8.4.0-alpha.1. | [1]https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/8bbe3efbcf4a3b66f4a8db9bfb18cd98c050db51<br>[2]https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/97763863b72689a29ad7a311dfb590c3e3c50585<br>[3]https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/pull/9903<br>[4]https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/pull/9904<br>[5]https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-x4qj-2f4q-r4rx |

| 15 | CVE-2025-10230 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | A flaw was found in Samba, in the front-end WINS hook handling: NetBIOS names from registration packets are passed to a shell without proper validation or escaping. Unsanitized NetBIOS name data from WINS registration packets are inserted into a shell command and executed by the Samba Active Directory Domain Controller’s wins hook, allowing an unauthenticated network attacker to achieve remote command execution as the Samba process. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-10230<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2394377<br>[3]https://www.samba.org/samba/history/security.html |
| 16 | CVE-2025-12863 | 7.5  | HIGH | A flaw was found in the xmlSetTreeDoc() function of the libxml2 XML parsing library. This function is responsible for updating document pointers when XML nodes are moved between documents. Due to improper handling of namespace references, a namespace pointer may remain linked to a freed memory region when the original document is destroyed. As a result, subsequent operations that access the namespace can lead to a use-after-free condition, causing an application crash. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-12863<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2413323 |
