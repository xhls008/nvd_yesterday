| 9 | CVE-2024-1696 | 7.8  | HIGH | In Santesoft Sante FFT Imaging versions 1.4.1 and prior once a user opens a malicious DCM file on affected FFT Imaging installations, a local attacker could perform an out-of-bounds write, which could allow for arbitrary code execution. | [1]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-medical-advisories/icsma-24-065-01 |
| 10 | CVE-2024-28187 | 7.2  | HIGH | SOY CMS is an open source CMS (content management system) that allows you to build blogs and online shops. SOY CMS versions prior to 3.14.2 are vulnerable to an OS Command Injection vulnerability within the file upload feature when accessed by an administrator. The vulnerability enables the execution of arbitrary OS commands through specially crafted file names containing a semicolon, affecting the jpegoptim functionality. This vulnerability has been patched in version 3.14.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/inunosinsi/soycms/commit/9b0e452f628df28dec69cd72b6b55db21066cbf8<br>[2]https://github.com/inunosinsi/soycms/security/advisories/GHSA-qg3q-hfgc-5jmm |
| 11 | CVE-2024-28197 | 7.5  | HIGH | Zitadel is an open source identity management system. Zitadel uses a cookie to identify the user agent (browser) and its user sessions.  Although the cookie was handled according to best practices, it was accessible on subdomains of the ZITADEL instance. An attacker could take advantage of this and provide a malicious link hosted on the subdomain to the user to gain access to the victimâ€™s account in certain scenarios. A possible victim would need to login through the malicious link for this exploit to work. If the possible victim already had the cookie present, the attack would not succeed. The attack would further only be possible if there was an initial vulnerability on the subdomain. This could either be the attacker being able to control DNS or a XSS vulnerability in an application hosted on a subdomain. Versions 2.46.0, 2.45.1, and 2.44.3 have been patched. Zitadel recommends upgrading to the latest versions available in due course. Note that applying the patch will invalidate the current cookie and thus users will need to start a new session and existing sessions (user selection) will be empty. For self-hosted environments unable to upgrade to a patched version, prevent setting the following cookie name on subdomains of your Zitadel instance (e.g. within your WAF): `__Secure-zitadel-useragent`. | [1]https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/security/advisories/GHSA-mq4x-r2w3-j7mr |
| 12 | CVE-2024-28199 | 7.1  | HIGH | phlex is an open source framework for building object-oriented views in Ruby. There is a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited via maliciously crafted user data. This was due to improper case-sensitivity in the code that was meant to prevent these attacks. If you render an `<a>` tag with an `href` attribute set to a user-provided link, that link could potentially execute JavaScript when clicked by another user. If you splat user-provided attributes when rendering any HTML tag, malicious event attributes could be included in the output, executing JavaScript when the events are triggered by another user. Patches are available on RubyGems for all 1.x minor versions. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should consider configuring a content security policy that does not allow `unsafe-inline`. | [1]https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy<br>[2]https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy#unsafe-inline<br>[3]https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/commit/aa50c604cdee1d0ce7ef068a4c66cbd5d43f96a1<br>[4]https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/security/advisories/GHSA-242p-4v39-2v8g |
