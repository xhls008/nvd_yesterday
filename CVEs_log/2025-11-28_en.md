| 1 | CVE-2025-66314 | 7.5  | HIGH | Improper Privilege Management vulnerability in ZTE ElasticNet UME R32 on Linux allows Accessing Functionality Not Properly Constrained by ACLs.This issue affects ElasticNet UME R32: ElasticNet_UME_R32_V16.23.20.04. | [1]https://support.zte.com.cn/zte-iccp-isupport-webui/bulletin/detail/2180460616364429350 |
| 2 | CVE-2025-12758 | 7.5  | HIGH | Versions of the package validator before 13.15.22 are vulnerable to Incomplete Filtering of One or More Instances of Special Elements in the isLength() function that does not take into account Unicode variation selectors (\uFE0F, \uFE0E) appearing in a sequence which lead to improper string length calculation. This can lead to an application using isLength for input validation accepting strings significantly longer than intended, resulting in issues like data truncation in databases, buffer overflows in other system components, or denial-of-service. | [1]https://gist.github.com/koral--/ad31208b25b9e3d1e2e35f1d4d72572e<br>[2]https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js/pull/2616<br>[3]https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-VALIDATOR-13653476 |
| 3 | CVE-2025-13538 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The FindAll Listing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.5. This is due to the `findall_listing_user_registration_additional_params` function not restricting what user roles a user can register with. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to supply the `administrator` role during registration and gain administrator access to the site. Note: The vulnerability can only be exploited if the FindAll Membership plugin is also activated, because user registration is in that plugin. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/findall-business-directory-theme/24415962<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/14981949-271c-4f98-a6a1-b00619f1436d?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2025-13539 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The FindAll Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.4. This is due to the plugin not properly logging in a user with the data that was previously verified through the `findall_membership_check_facebook_user` and the `findall_membership_check_google_user` functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as administrative users, as long as they have an existing account on the site which can easily be created by default through the temp user functionality, and access to the administrative user`s email. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/findall-business-directory-theme/24415962<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/a856a96a-68d2-462d-b523-840668980807?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2025-13540 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Tiare Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.2. This is due to the `tiare_membership_init_rest_api_register` function not restricting what user roles a user can register with. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to supply the `administrator` role during registration and gain administrator access to the site. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/tiare-wedding-vendor-directory-theme/26589165?s_rank=1<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6cf01a38-1fba-4c93-b3fa-acfdd5b19410?source=cve |
| 6 | CVE-2025-13675 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Tiger theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 101.2.1. This is due to the `paypal-submit.php` file not restricting what user roles a user can register with. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to supply the `administrator` role during registration and gain administrator access to the site. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/tiger-social-network-theme-for-companies-professionals/16203995<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/4750b57e-7d8d-49d7-bbbf-46483eb97bd9?source=cve |
| 7 | CVE-2025-13680 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Tiger theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 101.2.1. This is due to the plugin allowing a user to update the user role through the $user->set_role() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to elevate their privileges to that of an administrator. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/tiger-social-network-theme-for-companies-professionals/16203995<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/645f60ad-c8e5-47ec-94f1-960de4ef7838?source=cve |
| 8 | CVE-2025-7820 | 7.5  | HIGH | The SKT PayPal for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Payment Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.4. This is due to the plugin only enforcing client side controls instead of server-side controls when processing payments. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to make confirmed purchases without actually paying for them. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3403118%40skt-paypal-for-woocommerce&new=3403118%40skt-paypal-for-woocommerce&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/1a67b1b3-eb39-4e9a-ba44-ea637fc3bba1?source=cve |
| 9 | CVE-2025-13536 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Blubrry PowerPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type validation in all versions up to, and including, 11.15.2. This is due to the plugin validating file extensions but not halting execution when validation fails in the `powerpress_edit_post` function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/powerpress/tags/11.14.1/powerpressadmin.php#L2368<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/powerpress/tags/11.14.1/powerpressadmin.php#L3012<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/powerpress/tags/11.14.1/powerpressadmin.php#L3068<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3402635/<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d420ee49-e7b3-43d8-a263-8a93abd1133c?source=cve |
| 10 | CVE-2025-59890 | 7.3  | HIGH | Improper input sanitization in the file archives upload functionality of Eaton Galileo software allows traversing paths which could lead into an attacker with local access to execute unauthorized code or commands. This security issue has been fixed in the latest version of Galileo which is available on the Eaton download center. | [1]https://www.eaton.com/content/dam/eaton/company/news-insights/cybersecurity/security-bulletins/etn-va-2025-1024.pdf |
| 11 | CVE-2025-13692 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Unlimited Elements For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 2.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file. A form with a file upload field must be created with the premium version of the plugin in order to exploit the vulnerability. However, once the form exists, the vulnerability is exploitable even if the premium version is deactivated and/or uninstalled. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/unlimited-elements-for-elementor/trunk/inc_php/unitecreator_filters_process.class.php#L3279<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/unlimited-elements-for-elementor/trunk/inc_php/unitecreator_form.class.php#L1952<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/unlimited-elements-for-elementor/trunk/inc_php/unitecreator_form.class.php#L1960<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/unlimited-elements-for-elementor/trunk/inc_php/unitecreator_form.class.php#L598<br>[5]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3403331/<br>[6]https://unlimited-elements.com/change-log/<br>[7]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/ae603b13-dc09-4f83-8741-943d62615b3c?source=cve |
| 12 | CVE-2025-12419 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | Mattermost versions 10.12.x <= 10.12.1, 10.11.x <= 10.11.4, 10.5.x <= 10.5.12, 11.0.x <= 11.0.3 fail to properly validate OAuth state tokens during OpenID Connect authentication which allows an authenticated attacker with team creation privileges to take over a user account via manipulation of authentication data during the OAuth completion flow. This requires email verification to be disabled (default: disabled), OAuth/OpenID Connect to be enabled, and the attacker to control two users in the SSO system with one of them never having logged into Mattermost. | [1]https://mattermost.com/security-updates |
| 13 | CVE-2025-12421 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | Mattermost versions 11.0.x <= 11.0.2, 10.12.x <= 10.12.1, 10.11.x <= 10.11.4, 10.5.x <= 10.5.12 fail to to verify that the token used during the code exchange originates from the same authentication flow, which allows an authenticated user to perform account takeover via a specially crafted email address used when switching authentication methods and sending a request to the /users/login/sso/code-exchange endpoint. The vulnerability requires ExperimentalEnableAuthenticationTransfer to be enabled (default: enabled) and RequireEmailVerification to be disabled (default: disabled). | [1]https://mattermost.com/security-updates |
