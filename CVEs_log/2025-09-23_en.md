| 32 | CVE-2025-59335 | 7.1  | HIGH | CubeCart is an ecommerce software solution. Prior to version 6.5.11, there is an absence of automatic session expiration following a user`s password change. This oversight poses a security risk, as if a user forgets to log out from a location where they accessed their account, an unauthorized user can maintain access even after the password has been changed. Due to this bug, if an account has already been compromised, the legitimate user has no way to revoke the attacker’s access. The malicious actor retains full access to the account until their session naturally expires. This means the account remains insecure even after the password has been changed. This issue has been patched in version 6.5.11. | [1]https://github.com/cubecart/v6/commit/4bfaeb4485dd82255a108940a163af5ba4583b52<br>[2]https://github.com/cubecart/v6/commit/62d9be8416aa6fd7343f8932d98c5b112b163e26<br>[3]https://github.com/cubecart/v6/security/advisories/GHSA-4vwh-x8m2-fmvv<br>[4]https://github.com/cubecart/v6/security/advisories/GHSA-4vwh-x8m2-fmvv |

This can be used for reconnaissance and planning further attacks. | [1]https://github.com/shiky8/my--cve-vulnerability-research/tree/main/CVE-2025-57441<br>[2]https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/ |
| 40 | CVE-2025-59420 | 7.5  | HIGH | Authlib is a Python library which builds OAuth and OpenID Connect servers. Prior to version 1.6.4, Authlib’s JWS verification accepts tokens that declare unknown critical header parameters (crit), violating RFC 7515 “must‑understand” semantics. An attacker can craft a signed token with a critical header (for example, bork or cnf) that strict verifiers reject but Authlib accepts. In mixed‑language fleets, this enables split‑brain verification and can lead to policy bypass, replay, or privilege escalation. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.4. | [1]https://github.com/authlib/authlib/commit/6b1813e4392eb7c168c276099ff7783b176479df<br>[2]https://github.com/authlib/authlib/security/advisories/GHSA-9ggr-2464-2j32 |

| 82 | CVE-2025-59528 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | Flowise is a drag & drop user interface to build a customized large language model flow. In version 3.0.5, Flowise is vulnerable to remote code execution. The CustomMCP node allows users to input configuration settings for connecting to an external MCP server. This node parses the user-provided mcpServerConfig string to build the MCP server configuration. However, during this process, it executes JavaScript code without any security validation. Specifically, inside the convertToValidJSONString function, user input is directly passed to the Function() constructor, which evaluates and executes the input as JavaScript code. Since this runs with full Node.js runtime privileges, it can access dangerous modules such as child_process and fs.
