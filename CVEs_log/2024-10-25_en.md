| 20 | CVE-2024-10327 | 8.1  | HIGH | A vulnerability in Okta Verify for iOS versions 9.25.1 (beta) and 9.27.0 (including beta) allows push notification responses through the iOS ContextExtension feature allowing the authentication to proceed regardless of the user’s selection. When a user long-presses the notification banner and selects an option, both options allow the authentication to succeed. The ContextExtension feature is one of several push mechanisms available when using Okta Verify Push on iOS devices. The vulnerable flows include: * When a user is presented with a notification on a locked screen, the user presses on the notification directly and selects their reply without unlocking the device; * When a user is presented with a notification on the home screen and drags the notification down and selects their reply; * When an Apple Watch is used to reply directly to a notification.  A pre-condition for this vulnerability is that the user must have enrolled in Okta Verify while the Okta customer was using Okta Classic. This applies irrespective of whether the organization has since upgraded to Okta Identity Engine. | [1]https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/releasenotes/okta-verify-release-notes.htm#panel2<br>[2]https://trust.okta.com/security-advisories/okta-verify-for-ios-cve-2024-10327/ |
| 21 | CVE-2024-47878 | 8.1  | HIGH | OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. Prior to version 3.8.3, the `/extension/gdata/authorized` endpoint includes the `state` GET parameter verbatim in a `<script>` tag in the output, so without escaping. An attacker could lead or redirect a user to a crafted URL containing JavaScript code, which would then cause that code to be executed in the victim`s browser as if it was part of OpenRefine. Version 3.8.3 fixes this issue. | [1]https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/commit/10bf0874d67f1018a58b3732332d76b840192fea<br>[2]https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/security/advisories/GHSA-pw3x-c5vp-mfc3 |
| 22 | CVE-2024-47879 | 7.6  | HIGH | OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. Prior to version 3.8.3, lack of cross-site request forgery protection on the `preview-expression` command means that visiting a malicious website could cause an attacker-controlled expression to be executed. The expression can contain arbitrary Clojure or Python code. The attacker must know a valid project ID of a project that contains at least one row, and the attacker must convince the victim to open a malicious webpage. Version 3.8.3 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/commit/090924ca923489b6c94397cf1f5df7f7f78f0126<br>[2]https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/security/advisories/GHSA-3jm4-c6qf-jrh3 |
| 23 | CVE-2024-47880 | 8.1  | HIGH | OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. Prior to version 3.8.3, the `export-rows` command can be used in such a way that it reflects part of the request verbatim, with a Content-Type header also taken from the request. An attacker could lead a user to a malicious page that submits a form POST that contains  embedded JavaScript code. This code would then be included in the response, along with an attacker-controlled `Content-Type` header, and so potentially executed in the victim`s browser as if it was part of OpenRefine. The attacker-provided code can do anything the user can do, including deleting projects, retrieving database passwords, or executing arbitrary Jython or Closure expressions, if those extensions are also present. The attacker must know a valid project ID of a project that contains at least one row. Version 3.8.3 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/commit/8060477fa53842ebabf43b63e039745932fa629d<br>[2]https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/security/advisories/GHSA-79jv-5226-783f |
| 24 | CVE-2024-47881 | 8.1  | HIGH | OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. Starting in version 3.4-beta and prior to version 3.8.3, in the `database` extension, the "enable_load_extension" property can be set for the SQLite integration, enabling an attacker to load (local or remote) extension DLLs and so run arbitrary code on the server. The attacker needs to have network access to the OpenRefine instance. Version 3.8.3 fixes this issue. | [1]https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/commit/853a1d91662e7dc278a9a94a38be58de04494056<br>[2]https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/security/advisories/GHSA-87cf-j763-vvh8 |
| 25 | CVE-2024-47883 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | The OpenRefine fork of the MIT Simile Butterfly server is a modular web application framework. The Butterfly framework uses the `java.net.URL` class to refer to (what are expected to be) local resource files, like images or templates. This works: "opening a connection" to these URLs opens the local file. However, prior to version 1.2.6, if a `file:/` URL is directly given where a relative path (resource name) is expected, this is also accepted in some code paths; the app then fetches the file, from a remote machine if indicated, and uses it as if it was a trusted part of the app`s codebase. This leads to multiple weaknesses and potential weaknesses. An attacker that has network access to the application could use it to gain access to files, either on the the server`s filesystem (path traversal) or shared by nearby machines (server-side request forgery with e.g. SMB). An attacker that can lead or redirect a user to a crafted URL belonging to the app could cause arbitrary attacker-controlled JavaScript to be loaded in the victim`s browser (cross-site scripting). If an app is written in such a way that an attacker can influence the resource name used for a template, that attacker could cause the app to fetch and execute an attacker-controlled template (remote code execution). Version 1.2.6 contains a patch. | [1]https://github.com/OpenRefine/simile-butterfly/commit/537f64bfa72746f8b21d4bda461fad843435319c<br>[2]https://github.com/OpenRefine/simile-butterfly/security/advisories/GHSA-3p8v-w8mr-m3x8 |
| 26 | CVE-2024-48931 | 7.5  | HIGH | ZimaOS is a fork of CasaOS, an operating system for Zima devices and x86-64 systems with UEFI. In version 1.2.4 and all prior versions, the ZimaOS API endpoint `http://<Zima_Server_IP:PORT>/v3/file?token=<token>&files=<file_path>` is vulnerable to arbitrary file reading due to improper input validation. By manipulating the `files` parameter, authenticated users can read sensitive system files, including `/etc/shadow`, which contains password hashes for all users. This vulnerability exposes critical system data and poses a high risk for privilege escalation or system compromise. The vulnerability occurs because the API endpoint does not validate or restrict file paths provided via the `files` parameter. An attacker can exploit this by manipulating the file path to access sensitive files outside the intended directory. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available. | [1]https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS/security/advisories/GHSA-hjw2-9gq5-qgwj<br>[2]https://youtu.be/FyIfcmCyDXs |
| 27 | CVE-2024-7763 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | In WhatsUp Gold versions released before 2024.0.0, an Authentication Bypass issue exists which allows an attacker to obtain encrypted user credentials. | [1]https://community.progress.com/s/article/WhatsUp-Gold-Security-Bulletin-August-2024<br>[2]https://www.progress.com/network-monitoring |
| 28 | CVE-2024-49357 | 7.5  | HIGH | ZimaOS is a fork of CasaOS, an operating system for Zima devices and x86-64 systems with UEFI. In version 1.2.4 and all prior versions, the API endpoints in ZimaOS, such as `http://<Server-IP>/v1/users/image?path=/var/lib/casaos/1/app_order.json` and `http://<Server-IP>/v1/users/image?path=/var/lib/casaos/1/system.json`, expose sensitive data like installed applications and system information without requiring any authentication or authorization. This sensitive data leak can be exploited by attackers to gain detailed knowledge about the system setup, installed applications, and other critical information. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available. | [1]https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS/security/advisories/GHSA-hg2h-q5h6-r5c4<br>[2]https://youtu.be/H_WoqzM-9Cc |
| 29 | CVE-2024-49359 | 7.5  | HIGH | ZimaOS is a fork of CasaOS, an operating system for Zima devices and x86-64 systems with UEFI. In version 1.2.4 and all prior versions, the API endpoint `http://<Zima_Server_IP:PORT>/v2_1/file` in ZimaOS is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack, allowing authenticated users to list the contents of any directory on the server. By manipulating the path parameter, attackers can access sensitive system directories such as `/etc`, potentially exposing critical configuration files and increasing the risk of further attacks. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available. | [1]https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS/security/advisories/GHSA-mwpw-fhrm-728x<br>[2]https://youtu.be/IuaEH09ot9s |
| 30 | CVE-2024-49760 | 7.1  | HIGH | OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. The load-language command expects a `lang` parameter from which it constructs the path of the localization file to load, of the form `translations-$LANG.json`. But when doing so in versions prior to 3.8.3, it does not check that the resulting path is in the expected directory, which means that this command could be exploited to read other JSON files on the file system. Version 3.8.3 addresses this issue. | [1]https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/commit/24d084052dc55426fe460f2a17524fd18d28b20c<br>[2]https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/security/advisories/GHSA-qfwq-6jh6-8xx4 |
