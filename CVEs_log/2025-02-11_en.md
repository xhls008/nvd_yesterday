| 5 | CVE-2025-21693 | 7.8  | HIGH | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm: zswap: properly synchronize freeing resources during CPU hotunplugIn zswap_compress() and zswap_decompress(), the per-CPU acomp_ctx of thecurrent CPU at the beginning of the operation is retrieved and usedthroughout.  However, since neither preemption nor migration are disabled,it is possible that the operation continues on a different CPU.If the original CPU is hotunplugged while the acomp_ctx is still in use,we run into a UAF bug as some of the resources attached to the acomp_ctxare freed during hotunplug in zswap_cpu_comp_dead() (i.e. acomp_ctx.buffer, acomp_ctx.req, or acomp_ctx.acomp).The problem was introduced in commit 1ec3b5fe6eec ("mm/zswap: move to usecrypto_acomp API for hardware acceleration") when the switch to thecrypto_acomp API was made.  Prior to that, the per-CPU crypto_comp wasretrieved using get_cpu_ptr() which disables preemption and makes sure theCPU cannot go away from under us.  Preemption cannot be disabled with thecrypto_acomp API as a sleepable context is needed.Use the acomp_ctx.mutex to synchronize CPU hotplug callbacks allocatingand freeing resources with compression/decompression paths.  Make surethat acomp_ctx.req is NULL when the resources are freed.  In thecompression/decompression paths, check if acomp_ctx.req is NULL afteracquiring the mutex (meaning the CPU was offlined) and retry on the newCPU.The initialization of acomp_ctx.mutex is moved from the CPU hotplugcallback to the pool initialization where it belongs (where the mutex isallocated).  In addition to adding clarity, this makes sure that CPUhotplug cannot reinitialize a mutex that is already locked bycompression/decompression.Previously a fix was attempted by holding cpus_read_lock() [1].  Thiswould have caused a potential deadlock as it is possible for code alreadyholding the lock to fall into reclaim and enter zswap (causing adeadlock).  A fix was also attempted using SRCU for synchronization, butJohannes pointed out that synchronize_srcu() cannot be used in CPU hotplugnotifiers [2].Alternative fixes that were considered/attempted and could have worked:- Refcounting the per-CPU acomp_ctx. This involves complexity in  handling the race between the refcount dropping to zero in  zswap_[de]compress() and the refcount being re-initialized when the  CPU is onlined.- Disabling migration before getting the per-CPU acomp_ctx [3], but  that`s discouraged and is a much bigger hammer than needed, and could  result in subtle performance issues.[1]https://lkml.kernel.org/20241219212437.2714151-1-yosryahmed@google.com/[2]https://lkml.kernel.org/20250107074724.1756696-2-yosryahmed@google.com/[3]https://lkml.kernel.org/20250107222236.2715883-2-yosryahmed@google.com/[yosryahmed@google.com: remove comment]  Link: https://lkml.kernel.org/r/CAJD7tkaxS1wjn+swugt8QCvQ-rVF5RZnjxwPGX17k8x9zSManA@mail.gmail.com | [1]https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/12dcb0ef540629a281533f9dedc1b6b8e14cfb65<br>[2]https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8d29ff5d50304daa41dc3cfdda4a9d1e46cf5be1 |

| 16 | CVE-2025-24016 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. Starting in version 4.4.0 and prior to version 4.9.1, an unsafe deserialization vulnerability allows for remote code execution on Wazuh servers. DistributedAPI parameters are a serialized as JSON and deserialized using `as_wazuh_object` (in `framework/wazuh/core/cluster/common.py`). If an attacker manages to inject an unsanitized dictionary in DAPI request/response, they can forge an unhandled exception (`__unhandled_exc__`) to evaluate arbitrary python code. The vulnerability can be triggered by anybody with API access (compromised dashboard or Wazuh servers in the cluster) or, in certain configurations, even by a compromised agent. Version 4.9.1 contains a fix. | [1]https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/security/advisories/GHSA-hcrc-79hj-m3qh |
