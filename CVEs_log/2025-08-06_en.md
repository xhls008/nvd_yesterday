| 1 | CVE-2025-53544 | 7.5  | HIGH | Trilium Notes is an open-source, cross-platform hierarchical note taking application with focus on building large personal knowledge bases. In versions below 0.97.0, a brute-force protection bypass in the initial sync seed retrieval endpoint allows unauthenticated attackers to guess the login password without triggering rate limiting. Trilium is a single-user app without a username requirement, and brute-force protection bypass makes exploitation much more feasible. Multiple features provided by Trilium (e.g. MFA, share notes, custom request handler) indicate that Trilium can be exposed to the internet. This is fixed in version 0.97.0. | [1]https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium/pull/6243/commits/04c8f8a1234e8c9f4a87da187180375227b21223<br>[2]https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium/releases/tag/v0.97.0<br>[3]https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium/security/advisories/GHSA-hw5p-ff75-327r<br>[4]https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium/security/advisories/GHSA-hw5p-ff75-327r |
| 2 | CVE-2025-54119 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | ADOdb is a PHP database class library that provides abstractions for performing queries and managing databases. In versions 5.22.9 and below, improper escaping of a query parameter may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL statements when the code using ADOdb connects to a sqlite3 database and calls the metaColumns(), metaForeignKeys() or metaIndexes() methods with a crafted table name. This is fixed in version 5.22.10. To workaround this issue, only pass controlled data to metaColumns(), metaForeignKeys() and metaIndexes() method`s $table parameter. | [1]https://github.com/ADOdb/ADOdb/commit/5b8bd52cdcffefb4ecded1b399c98cfa516afe03<br>[2]https://github.com/ADOdb/ADOdb/issues/1083<br>[3]https://github.com/ADOdb/ADOdb/security/advisories/GHSA-vf2r-cxg9-p7rf |
| 3 | CVE-2025-54130 | 7.5  | HIGH | Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. Cursor allows writing in-workspace files with no user approval in versions less than 1.3.9. If the file is a dotfile, editing it requires approval but creating a new one doesn`t. Hence, if sensitive editor files, such as the .vscode/settings.json file don`t already exist in the workspace, an attacker can chain a indirect prompt injection vulnerability to hijack the context to write to the settings file and trigger RCE on the victim without user approval. This is fixed in version 1.3.9. | [1]https://github.com/cursor/cursor/security/advisories/GHSA-vqv7-vq92-x87f |
| 4 | CVE-2025-54135 | 8.5  | HIGH | Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. Cursor allows writing in-workspace files with no user approval in versions below 1.3.9, If the file is a dotfile, editing it requires approval but creating a new one doesn`t. Hence, if sensitive MCP files, such as the .cursor/mcp.json file don`t already exist in the workspace, an attacker can chain a indirect prompt injection vulnerability to hijack the context to write to the settings file and trigger RCE on the victim without user approval. This is fixed in version 1.3.9. | [1]https://github.com/cursor/cursor/security/advisories/GHSA-4cxx-hrm3-49rm |
| 5 | CVE-2025-54780 | 7.7  | HIGH | The glpi-screenshot-plugin allows users to take screenshots or screens recording directly from GLPI. In versions below 2.0.2, authenticated user can use the /ajax/screenshot.php endpoint to leak files from the system or use PHP wrappers. This is fixed in version 2.0.2. | [1]https://github.com/cconard96/glpi-screenshot-plugin/commit/49215b53a05dc792719b69c098df80100208c2c8<br>[2]https://github.com/cconard96/glpi-screenshot-plugin/security/advisories/GHSA-x6mp-jhxw-9xrp |
| 6 | CVE-2025-54802 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | pyLoad is the free and open-source Download Manager written in pure Python. In versions 0.5.0b3.dev89 and below, there is an opportunity for path traversal in pyLoad-ng CNL Blueprint via package parameter, allowing Arbitrary File Write which leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The addcrypted endpoint in pyload-ng suffers from an unsafe path construction vulnerability, allowing unauthenticated attackers to write arbitrary files outside the designated storage directory. This can be abused to overwrite critical system files, including cron jobs and systemd services, leading to privilege escalation and remote code execution as root. This issue is fixed in version 0.5.0b3.dev90. | [1]https://github.com/pyload/pyload/commit/70a44fe02c03bce92337b5d370d2a45caa4de3d4<br>[2]https://github.com/pyload/pyload/pull/4596<br>[3]https://github.com/pyload/pyload/security/advisories/GHSA-48rp-jc79-2264<br>[4]https://github.com/pyload/pyload/security/advisories/GHSA-48rp-jc79-2264 |
| 7 | CVE-2025-54865 | 7.3  | HIGH | Tilesheets MediaWiki Extension adds a table lookup parser function for an item and returns the requested image. A missing backtick in a query executed by the Tilesheets extension allows users to insert and potentially execute malicious SQL code. This issue has not been fixed. | [1]https://github.com/FTB-Gamepedia/Tilesheets/blob/8debbf8ee6ddb02bf9c756bab5c085b007d72c50/special/SheetManager.php#L255<br>[2]https://github.com/FTB-Gamepedia/Tilesheets/security/advisories/GHSA-hqfr-7cm9-4h87 |
| 8 | CVE-2025-54868 | 7.5  | HIGH | LibreChat is a ChatGPT clone with additional features. In versions 0.0.6 through 0.7.7-rc1, an exposed testing endpoint allows reading arbitrary chats directly from the Meilisearch engine. The endpoint /api/search/test allows for direct access to stored chats in the Meilisearch engine without proper access control. This results in the ability to read chats from arbitrary users. This issue is fixed in version 0.7.7. | [1]https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/commit/0e8041bcac616949c42a68dfb8f108ccc4db5151<br>[2]https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/security/advisories/GHSA-p5j8-m4wh-ffmw |

| 10 | CVE-2025-7050 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Use-your-Drive | Google Drive plugin for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the `title` parameter in file metadata in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The vulnerability can be exploited by the lowest authentication level permitted to upload files, including unauthenticated users, once a file upload shortcode is published on a publicly accessible post. | [1]https://wpcloudplugins.gitbook.io/docs/other/changelog<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/de0c8922-b290-4582-9079-e79da684bcff?source=cve |

| 12 | CVE-2025-5061 | 7.5  | HIGH | The WP Import Export Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the `wpie_parse_upload_data` function in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.29. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and permissions granted by an Administrator, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 3.9.29. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-import-export-lite/trunk/includes/classes/import/class-wpie-upload-validate.php#L24<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-import-export-lite/trunk/includes/classes/import/class-wpie-upload-validate.php#L89<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3323402/<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3338701/<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/5c0f3248-fef6-48a5-b2e1-f2778528fba1?source=cve |
| 13 | CVE-2025-6207 | 7.5  | HIGH | The WP Import Export Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the `wpie_tempalte_import` function in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.28. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and permissions granted by an Administrator, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-import-export-lite/trunk/includes/classes/class-wpie-common-action.php#L386<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3323402/<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/188eef67-de66-49c2-aa6c-2cf3b886ff66?source=cve |
