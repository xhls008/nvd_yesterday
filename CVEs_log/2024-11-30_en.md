| 1 | CVE-2024-11992 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | Absolute path traversal vulnerability in Quick.CMS, version 6.7, the exploitation of which could allow remote users to bypass the intended restrictions and download any file if it has the appropriate permissions outside of documentroot configured on the server via the aDirFiles%5B0%5D parameter in the admin.php page. This vulnerability allows an attacker to delete files stored on the server due to a lack of proper verification of user-supplied input. | [1]https://www.incibe.es/en/incibe-cert/notices/aviso/path-traversal-vulnerability-quickcms |

| 8 | CVE-2024-49803 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | IBM Security Verify Access Appliance 10.0.0 through 10.0.8 could allow a remote authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system by sending a specially crafted request. | [1]https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/7177447 |
| 9 | CVE-2024-49804 | 7.8  | HIGH | IBM Security Verify Access Appliance 10.0.0 through 10.0.8 could allow a locally authenticated non-administrative user to escalate their privileges due to unnecessary permissions used to perform certain tasks. | [1]https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/7177447 |

| 12 | CVE-2024-49360 | 9.2  | CRITICAL | Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems. An authenticated user (**UserA**) with no privileges is authorized to read all files created in sandbox belonging to other users in the sandbox folders `C:\Sandbox\UserB\xxx`. An authenticated attacker who can use `explorer.exe` or `cmd.exe` outside any sandbox can read other users` files in `C:\Sandbox\xxx`. By default in Windows 7+, the `C:\Users\UserA` folder is not readable by **UserB**.All files edited or created during the sandbox processing are affected by the vulnerability. All files in C:\Users are safe. If `UserB` runs a cmd in a sandbox, he will be able to access `C:\Sandox\UserA`. In addition, if **UserB** create a folder `C:\Sandbox\UserA` with malicious ACLs, when **UserA** will user the sandbox, Sandboxie doesn`t reset ACLs ! This issue has not yet been fixed. Users are advised to limit access to their systems using Sandboxie. | [1]https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/security/advisories/GHSA-4chj-3c28-gvmp |
| 13 | CVE-2024-53848 | 7.1  | HIGH | check-jsonschema is a CLI and set of pre-commit hooks for jsonschema validation. The default cache strategy uses the basename of a remote schema as the name of the file in the cache, e.g. `https://example.org/schema.json` will be stored as `schema.json`. This naming allows for conflicts. If an attacker can get a user to run `check-jsonschema` against a malicious schema URL, e.g., `https://example.evil.org/schema.json`, they can insert their own schema into the cache and it will be picked up and used instead of the appropriate schema. Such a cache confusion attack could be used to allow data to pass validation which should have been rejected. This issue has been patched in version 0.30.0. All users are advised to upgrade. A few workarounds exist: 1. Users can use `--no-cache` to disable caching. 2. Users can use `--cache-filename` to select filenames for use in the cache, or to ensure that other usages do not overwrite the cached schema. (Note: this flag is being deprecated as part of the remediation effort.) 3. Users can explicitly download the schema before use as a local file, as in `curl -LOs https://example.org/schema.json; check-jsonschema --schemafile ./schema.json` | [1]https://github.com/python-jsonschema/check-jsonschema/commit/c52714b85e6725b1b24516fbdedacb333b939152<br>[2]https://github.com/python-jsonschema/check-jsonschema/security/advisories/GHSA-q6mv-284r-mp36 |
| 14 | CVE-2024-53865 | 8.2  | HIGH | zhmcclient is a pure Python client library for the IBM Z HMC Web Services API. In affected versions the Python package "zhmcclient" writes password-like properties in clear text into its HMC and API logs in the following cases: 1. The `boot-ftp-password` and `ssc-master-pw` properties when creating or updating a partition in DPM mode, in the zhmcclient API and HMC logs. 2. The `ssc-master-pw` and `zaware-master-pw` properties when updating an LPAR in classic mode, in the zhmcclient API and HMC logs. 3. The `ssc-master-pw` and `zaware-master-pw` properties when creating or updating an image activation profile in classic mode, in the zhmcclient API and HMC logs. 4. The `password` property when creating or updating an HMC user, in the zhmcclient API log. 5. The `bind-password` property when creating or updating an LDAP server definition, in the zhmcclient API and HMC logs. This issue affects only users of the zhmcclient package that have enabled the Python loggers named "zhmcclient.api" (for the API log) or "zhmcclient.hmc" (for the HMC log) and that use the functions listed above. This issue has been fixed in zhmcclient version 1.18.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/zhmcclient/python-zhmcclient/commit/ad32781e782d0f604c6da4680fce48e4cc1f4433<br>[2]https://github.com/zhmcclient/python-zhmcclient/security/advisories/GHSA-p57h-3cmc-xpjq |
| 15 | CVE-2024-53979 | 8.2  | HIGH | ibm.ibm_zhmc is an Ansible collection for the IBM Z HMC. The Ansible collection "ibm.ibm_zhmc" writes password-like properties in clear text into its log file and into the output returned by some of its Ansible module in the following cases: 1. The `boot_ftp_password` and `ssc_master_pw` properties are passed as input to the zhmc_partition Ansible module. 2. The `ssc_master_pw` and `zaware_master_pw` properties are passed as input to the zhmc_lpar Ansible module. 3. The `password` property is passed as input to the zhmc_user Ansible module (just in log file, not in module output). 4. The `bind_password` property is passed as input to the zhmc_ldap_server_definition Ansible module. These properties appear in the module output only when they were specified in the module input and when creating or updating the corresponding resources. They do not appear in the output when retrieving facts for the corresponding resources. These properties appear in the log file only when the "log_file" module input parameter is used. By default, no log file is created. This issue has been fixed in ibm.ibm_zhmc version 1.9.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmc-ansible-modules/commit/f5579f07da5f02d2496c41a313d4ae7a0a459b1d<br>[2]https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmc-ansible-modules/security/advisories/GHSA-mw6c-f428-jx4f |
