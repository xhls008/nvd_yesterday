| 26 | CVE-2024-6563 | 7.5  | HIGH | Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input (`Classic Buffer Overflow`) vulnerability in Renesas arm-trusted-firmware allows Local Execution of Code. This vulnerability is associated with program files  https://github.Com/renesas-rcar/arm-trusted-firmware/blob/rcar_gen3_v2.5/drivers/renesas/common/io/i... https://github.Com/renesas-rcar/arm-trusted-firmware/blob/rcar_gen3_v2.5/drivers/renesas/common/io/io_rcar.C .In line 313 "addr_loaded_cnt" is checked not to be "CHECK_IMAGE_AREA_CNT" (5) or larger, this check does not halt the function. Immediately after (line 317) there will be an overflow in the buffer and the value of "dst" will be written to the area immediately after the buffer, which is "addr_loaded_cnt". This will allow an attacker to freely control the value of "addr_loaded_cnt" and thus control the destination of the write immediately after (line 318). The write in line 318 will then be fully controlled by said attacker, with whichever address and whichever value ("len") they desire. | [1]https://asrg.io/security-advisories/cve-2024-6563/<br>[2]https://github.com/renesas-rcar/arm-trusted-firmware/commit/235f85b654a031f7647e81b86fc8e4ffeb430164 |
| 27 | CVE-2024-39896 | 7.5  | HIGH | Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content.

This is possible because if an email address exists in Directus and belongs to a known SSO provider then it will throw a "helpful" error that the user belongs to another provider. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.0. | [1]https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/454cb534d6ffa547feb11f4d74b932ae7368dae2<br>[2]https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-jgf4-vwc3-r46v |
| 28 | CVE-2024-6409 | 7.0  | HIGH | A signal handler race condition vulnerability was found in OpenSSH`s server (sshd), where a client does not authenticate within LoginGraceTime seconds (120 by default, 600 in old OpenSSH versions), then sshd`s SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously. However, this signal handler calls various functions that are not async-signal-safe, for example, syslog(). This issue leaves it vulnerable to a signal handler race condition on the cleanup_exit() function, which introduces the same vulnerability as CVE-2024-6387 in the unprivileged child of the SSHD server. | [1]http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/08/2<br>[2]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-6409<br>[3]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2295085 |
| 29 | CVE-2024-5971 | 7.5  | HIGH | A vulnerability was found in Undertow, where the chunked response hangs after the body was flushed. The response headers and body were sent but the client would continue waiting as Undertow does not send the expected 0\r\n termination of the chunked response. This results in uncontrolled resource consumption, leaving the server side to a denial of service attack. This happens only with Java 17 TLSv1.3 scenarios. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-5971<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2292211 |
