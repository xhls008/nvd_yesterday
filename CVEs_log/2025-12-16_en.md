| 13 | CVE-2025-14156 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Fox LMS – WordPress LMS Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.5.1. This is due to the plugin not properly validating the `role` parameter when creating new users via the `/fox-lms/v1/payments/create-order` REST API endpoint. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create new user accounts with arbitrary roles, including administrator, leading to complete site compromise. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?old_path=%2Ffox-lms%2Ftags%2F1.0.5.0%2Fincludes%2Frest%2FPayments.php&new_path=%2Ffox-lms%2Ftags%2F1.0.5.2%2Fincludes%2Frest%2FPayments.php<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/de4f8d45-9522-4a32-bc98-be8dbf3a5cf1?source=cve |

| 17 | CVE-2025-13888 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | A flaw was found in OpenShift GitOps. Namespace admins can create ArgoCD Custom Resources (CRs) that trick the system into granting them elevated permissions in other namespaces, including privileged namespaces. An authenticated attacker can then use these elevated permissions to create privileged workloads that run on master nodes, effectively giving them root access to the entire cluster. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:23203<br>[2]https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:23206<br>[3]https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:23207<br>[4]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-13888<br>[5]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2418361 |

| 19 | CVE-2025-11393 | 8.7  | HIGH | A flaw was found in runtimes-inventory-rhel8-operator. An internal proxy component is incorrectly configured. Because of this flaw, the proxy attaches the cluster`s main administrative credentials to any command it receives, instead of only the specific reports it is supposed to handle.This allows a standard user within the cluster to send unauthorized commands to the management platform, effectively acting with the full permissions of the cluster administrator. This could lead to unauthorized changes to the cluster`s configuration or status on the Red Hat platform. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-11393<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2402032 |
| 20 | CVE-2025-65742 | 8.2  | HIGH | An unauthenticated Broken Function Level Authorization (BFLA) vulnerability in Newgen OmniDocs v11.0 allows attackers to obtain sensitive information and execute a full account takeover via a crafted API request. | [1]https://github.com/CBx216/CVE-2025-65742-Newgen-OmniDocs-LDAP-BFLA/blob/main/CVE-2025-65742.md<br>[2]https://newgensoft.com/ |
| 21 | CVE-2025-14038 | 7.0  | HIGH | EDB Hybrid Manager contains a flaw that allows an unauthenticated attacker to directly access certain gRPC endpoints. This could allow an attacker to read potentially sensitive data or possibly cause a denial-of-service by writing malformed data to certain gRPC endpoints. This flaw has been remediated in EDB Hybrid Manager 1.3.3, and customers should consider upgrading to 1.3.3 as soon as possible.The flaw is due to a misconfiguration in the Istio Gateway, which manages authentication and authorization for the affected endpoints. The security policy relies on an explicit definition of required permissions in the Istio Gateway configuration, and the affected endpoints were not defined in the configuration. This allowed requests to bypass both authentication and authorization within a Hybrid Manager service.All versions of Hybrid Manager - LTS should be upgraded to 1.3.3, and all versions of Hybrid Manager - Innovation should be upgraded to 2025.12. | [1]https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/security/advisories/cve202514038/ |
| 22 | CVE-2025-65213 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | MooreThreads torch_musa through all versions contains an unsafe deserialization vulnerability in torch_musa.utils.compare_tool. The compare_for_single_op() and nan_inf_track_for_single_op() functions use pickle.load() on user-controlled file paths without validation, allowing arbitrary code execution. An attacker can craft a malicious pickle file that executes arbitrary Python code when loaded, enabling remote code execution with the privileges of the victim process. | [1]https://github.com/MooreThreads/torch_musa/issues/110#issuecomment-3475809588 |
| 23 | CVE-2025-14503 | 7.2  | HIGH | An overly-permissive IAM trust policy in the Harmonix on AWS framework may allow authenticated users to escalate privileges via role assumption. The sample code for the EKS environment provisioning role is configured to trust the account root principal, which may enable any account principal with sts:AssumeRole permissions to assume the role with administrative privileges. We recommend customers upgrade to Harmonix on AWS v0.4.2 or later if you have deployed the framework using versions v0.3.0 through v0.4.1. | [1]https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2025-031/<br>[2]https://github.com/awslabs/harmonix/pull/189<br>[3]https://github.com/awslabs/harmonix/security/advisories/GHSA-qm86-gqrq-mqcw |
