| 1 | CVE-2024-3240 | 8.8  | HIGH | The ConvertPlug plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.25 via deserialization of untrusted input from the `settings_encoded` attribute of the `smile_info_bar` shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. | [1]https://www.convertplug.com/plus/product/convertplug/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/fca3259b-bf0e-4b4a-815f-1eb399b8b674?source=cve |
