| 1 | CVE-2026-1202 | 7.3  | HIGH | A security flaw has been discovered in CRMEB up to 5.6.3. The affected element is the function appleLogin of the file crmeb/app/api/controller/v1/LoginController.php. Performing a manipulation of the argument openId results in improper authentication. The attack is possible to be carried out remotely. The exploit has been released to the public and may be used for attacks. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way. | [1]https://github.com/foeCat/CVE/blob/main/CRMEB/apple_login_auth_bypass.md<br>[2]https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.341788<br>[3]https://vuldb.com/?id.341788<br>[4]https://vuldb.com/?submit.734711 |
| 2 | CVE-2026-23876 | 8.1  | HIGH | ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital images. Prior to versions 7.1.2-13 and 6.9.13-38, a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the XBM image decoder (ReadXBMImage) allows an attacker to write controlled data past the allocated heap buffer when processing a maliciously crafted image file. Any operation that reads or identifies an image can trigger the overflow, making it exploitable via common image upload and processing pipelines. Versions 7.1.2-13 and 6.9.13-38 fix the issue. | [1]https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/2fae24192b78fdfdd27d766fd21d90aeac6ea8b8<br>[2]https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/security/advisories/GHSA-r49w-jqq3-3gx8 |
| 3 | CVE-2026-23949 | 8.6  | HIGH | jaraco.context, an open-source software package that provides some useful decorators and context managers, has a Zip Slip path traversal vulnerability in the `jaraco.context.tarball()` function starting in version 5.2.0 and prior to version 6.1.0. The vulnerability may allow attackers to extract files outside the intended extraction directory when malicious tar archives are processed. The strip_first_component filter splits the path on the first `/` and extracts the second component, while allowing `../` sequences. Paths like `dummy_dir/../../etc/passwd` become `../../etc/passwd`. Note that this suffers from a nested tarball attack as well with multi-level tar files such as `dummy_dir/inner.tar.gz`, where the inner.tar.gz includes a traversal `dummy_dir/../../config/.env` that also gets translated to `../../config/.env`. Version 6.1.0 contains a patch for the issue. | [1]https://github.com/jaraco/jaraco.context/blob/main/jaraco/context/__init__.py#L74-L91<br>[2]https://github.com/jaraco/jaraco.context/commit/7b26a42b525735e4085d2e994e13802ea339d5f9<br>[3]https://github.com/jaraco/jaraco.context/security/advisories/GHSA-58pv-8j8x-9vj2<br>[4]https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/blob/main/setuptools/_vendor/jaraco/context.py#L55-L76 |
| 4 | CVE-2026-23950 | 8.8  | HIGH | node-tar,a Tar for Node.js, has a race condition vulnerability in versions up to and including 7.5.3. This is due to an incomplete handling of Unicode path collisions in the `path-reservations` system. On case-insensitive or normalization-insensitive filesystems (such as macOS APFS, In which it has been tested), the library fails to lock colliding paths (e.g., `ß` and `ss`), allowing them to be processed in parallel. This bypasses the library`s internal concurrency safeguards and permits Symlink Poisoning attacks via race conditions. The library uses a `PathReservations` system to ensure that metadata checks and file operations for the same path are serialized. This prevents race conditions where one entry might clobber another concurrently. This is a Race Condition which enables Arbitrary File Overwrite. This vulnerability affects users and systems using node-tar on macOS (APFS/HFS+). Because of using `NFD` Unicode normalization (in which `ß` and `ss` are different), conflicting paths do not have their order properly preserved under filesystems that ignore Unicode normalization (e.g., APFS (in which `ß` causes an inode collision with `ss`)). This enables an attacker to circumvent internal parallelization locks (`PathReservations`) using conflicting filenames within a malicious tar archive. The patch in version 7.5.4 updates `path-reservations.js` to use a normalization form that matches the target filesystem`s behavior (e.g., `NFKD`), followed by first `toLocaleLowerCase(`en`)` and then `toLocaleUpperCase(`en`)`. As a workaround, users who cannot upgrade promptly, and who are programmatically using `node-tar` to extract arbitrary tarball data should filter out all `SymbolicLink` entries (as npm does) to defend against arbitrary file writes via this file system entry name collision issue. | [1]https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/commit/3b1abfae650056edfabcbe0a0df5954d390521e6<br>[2]https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-r6q2-hw4h-h46w |

| 29 | CVE-2025-56005 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | An undocumented and unsafe feature in the PLY (Python Lex-Yacc) library 3.11 allows Remote Code Execution (RCE) via the `picklefile` parameter in the `yacc()` function. This parameter accepts a `.pkl` file that is deserialized with `pickle.load()` without validation. Because `pickle` allows execution of embedded code via `__reduce__()`, an attacker can achieve code execution by passing a malicious pickle file. The parameter is not mentioned in official documentation or the GitHub repository, yet it is active in the PyPI version. This introduces a stealthy backdoor and persistence risk. | [1]https://github.com/bohmiiidd/Undocumented-RCE-in-PLY |
