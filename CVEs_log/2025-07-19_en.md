| 1 | CVE-2025-6185 | 9.3  | CRITICAL | Leviton AcquiSuite and Energy Monitoring Hub are susceptible to a cross-site scripting vulnerability, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious payload in URL parameters, which would execute in a client browser when accessed by a user, steal session tokens, and control the service. | [1]https://leviton.com/support/resources/product-support<br>[2]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-25-198-01 |
| 2 | CVE-2025-3740 | 8.8  | HIGH | The School Management System for Wordpress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 93.1.0 via the `page` parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included. The Local File Inclusion exploit can be chained to include various dashboard view files in the plugin. One such chain can be leveraged to update the password of Super Administrator accounts in Multisite environments making privilege escalation possible. The vendor has updated the version numbers beginning with `1.93.1 (02-07-2025)` for the patched version. This version comes after version 93.1.0. | [1]https://codecanyon.net/item/school-management-system-for-wordpress/11470032#item-description__update-history<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/3604aece-5e76-4e8e-9caf-f518d6001277?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2025-6813 | 8.8  | HIGH | The aapanel WP Toolkit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to missing authorization checks within the auto_login() function in versions 1.0 to 1.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to bypass all role checks and gain full admin privileges. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/aapanel-wp-toolkit/tags/1.1/includes/class-aapanel-wp-toolkit-agent.php#L74<br>[2]https://wordpress.org/plugins/aapanel-wp-toolkit/#developers<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/430a0b93-2cb7-45bf-86ac-4a8b3a0be77a?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2025-6222 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The WooCommerce Refund And Exchange with RMA - Warranty Management, Refund Policy, Manage User Wallet theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the `ced_rnx_order_exchange_attach_files` function in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://codecanyon.net/item/woocommerce-refund-and-exchange/17810207#item-description__changelog<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/35a7b5a1-b052-4390-8e08-f97aa9c16b29?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2025-6718 | 8.8  | HIGH | The B1.lt plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to a missing capability check on the b1_run_query AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.56.

| 9 | CVE-2025-7444 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The LoginPress Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 5.0.1. This is due to insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the email and the user does not have an already-existing account for the service returning the token. | [1]https://loginpress.pro/changelog/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/80fcb3af-0b27-4442-aca0-58626b68f0d9?source=cve |

| 11 | CVE-2025-54073 | 7.5  | HIGH | mcp-package-docs is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides LLMs with efficient access to package documentation across multiple programming languages and language server protocol (LSP) capabilities. A command injection vulnerability exists in the `mcp-package-docs` MCP Server prior to the fix in commit cb4ad49615275379fd6f2f1cf1ec4731eec56eb9. The vulnerability is caused by the unsanitized use of input parameters within a call to `child_process.exec`, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the server process`s privileges. The server constructs and executes shell commands using unvalidated user input directly within command-line strings. This introduces the possibility of shell metacharacter injection (`|`, `>`, `&&`, etc.). Commit cb4ad49615275379fd6f2f1cf1ec4731eec56eb9 in version 0.1.27 contains a fix for the issue, but upgrading to 0.1.28 is recommended. | [1]https://equixly.com/blog/2025/03/29/mcp-server-new-security-nightmare<br>[2]https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3q26-f695-pp76<br>[3]https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5w57-2ccq-8w95<br>[4]https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gjv4-ghm7-q58q<br>[5]https://github.com/sammcj/mcp-package-docs/commit/cb4ad49615275379fd6f2f1cf1ec4731eec56eb9<br>[6]https://github.com/sammcj/mcp-package-docs/releases/tag/v0.1.27<br>[7]https://github.com/sammcj/mcp-package-docs/releases/tag/v0.1.28<br>[8]https://github.com/sammcj/mcp-package-docs/security/advisories/GHSA-vf9j-h32g-2764<br>[9]https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/mcp-github-vulnerability |
| 12 | CVE-2025-54075 | 8.3  | HIGH | MDC is a tool to take regular Markdown and write documents interacting deeply with a Vue component. Prior to version 0.17.2, a remote script-inclusion / stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in @nuxtjs/mdc lets a Markdown author inject a `<base href="https://attacker.tld">` element. The `<base>` tag rewrites how all subsequent relative URLs are resolved, so an attacker can make the page load scripts, styles, or images from an external, attacker-controlled origin and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the site’s context. Version 0.17.2 contains a fix for the issue. | [1]https://github.com/nuxt-modules/mdc/commit/3657a5bf2326a73cd3d906f57149146a412b962a<br>[2]https://github.com/nuxt-modules/mdc/security/advisories/GHSA-cj6r-rrr9-fg82 |
