| 15 | CVE-2025-29785 | 7.5  | HIGH | quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. The loss recovery logic for path probe packets that was added in the v0.50.0 release can be used to trigger a nil-pointer dereference by a malicious QUIC client. In order to do so, the attacker first sends valid QUIC packets from different remote addresses (thereby triggering the newly added path validation logic: the server sends path probe packets), and then sending ACKs for packets received from the server specifically crafted to trigger the nil-pointer dereference. v0.50.1 contains a patch that fixes the vulnerability. This release contains a test that generates random sequences of sent packets (both regular and path probe packets), that was used to verify that the patch actually covers all corner cases. No known workarounds are available. | [1]https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/commit/b90058aba5f65f48e0e150c89bbaa21a72dda4de<br>[2]https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/issues/4981<br>[3]https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/security/advisories/GHSA-j972-j939-p2v3 |
| 16 | CVE-2025-48957 | 7.5  | HIGH | AstrBot is a large language model chatbot and development framework. A path traversal vulnerability present in versions 3.4.4 through 3.5.12 may lead to information disclosure, such as API keys for LLM providers, account passwords, and other sensitive data. The vulnerability has been addressed in Pull Request #1676 and is included in version 3.5.13. As a workaround, users can edit the `cmd_config.json` file to disable the dashboard feature as a temporary workaround. However, it is strongly recommended to upgrade to version v3.5.13 or later to fully resolve this issue. | [1]https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot/commit/cceadf222c46813c7f41115b40d371e7eb91e492<br>[2]https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot/issues/1675<br>[3]https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot/pull/1676<br>[4]https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot/security/advisories/GHSA-cq37-g2qp-3c2p<br>[5]https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot/security/advisories/GHSA-cq37-g2qp-3c2p |

| 26 | CVE-2025-48866 | 7.5  | HIGH | ModSecurity is an open source, cross platform web application firewall (WAF) engine for Apache, IIS and Nginx. Versions prior to 2.9.10 contain a denial of service vulnerability similar to GHSA-859r-vvv8-rm8r/CVE-2025-47947. The `sanitiseArg` (and `sanitizeArg` - this is the same action but an alias) is vulnerable to adding an excessive number of arguments, thereby leading to denial of service. Version 2.9.10 fixes the issue. As a workaround, avoid using rules that contain the  `sanitiseArg` (or `sanitizeArg`) action. | [1]https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/ModSecurity/commit/3a54ccea62d3f7151bb08cb78d60c5e90b53ca2e<br>[2]https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/ModSecurity/security/advisories/GHSA-859r-vvv8-rm8r<br>[3]https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/ModSecurity/security/advisories/GHSA-f82j-8pp7-cw2w<br>[4]https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-v2.x |
| 27 | CVE-2025-48940 | 7.2  | HIGH | MyBB is free and open source forum software. Prior to version 1.8.39, the upgrade component does not validate user input properly, which allows attackers to perform local file inclusion (LFI) via a specially crafted parameter value. In order to exploit the vulnerability, the installer must be unlocked (no `install/lock` file present) and the upgrade script must be accessible (by re-installing the forum via access to `install/index.php`; when the forum has not yet been installed; or the attacker is authenticated as a forum administrator). MyBB 1.8.39 resolves this issue. | [1]https://github.com/mybb/mybb/commit/6e6cfbd524d9101b51e1278ecf520479b64b0f00<br>[2]https://github.com/mybb/mybb/security/advisories/GHSA-q4jv-xwjx-37cp<br>[3]https://mybb.com/versions/1.8.39 |
