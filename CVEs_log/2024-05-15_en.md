| 1 | CVE-2022-4967 | 7.7  | HIGH | strongSwan versions 5.9.2 through 5.9.5 are affected by authorization bypass through improper validation of certificate with host mismatch (CWE-297). When certificates are used to authenticate clients in TLS-based EAP methods, the IKE or EAP identity supplied by a client is not enforced to be contained in the client`s certificate. So clients can authenticate with any trusted certificate and claim an arbitrary IKE/EAP identity as their own. This is problematic if the identity is used to make policy decisions. A fix was released in strongSwan version 5.9.6 in August 2022 (e4b4aabc4996fc61c37deab7858d07bc4d220136). | [1]https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/commit/e4b4aabc4996fc61c37deab7858d07bc4d220136<br>[2]https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-4967<br>[3]https://www.strongswan.org/blog/2024/05/13/strongswan-vulnerability-cve-2022-4967 |

| 27 | CVE-2024-32655 | 8.1  | HIGH | Npgsql is the .NET data provider for PostgreSQL. The `WriteBind()` method in `src/Npgsql/Internal/NpgsqlConnector.FrontendMessages.cs` uses `int` variables to store the message length and the sum of parameter lengths. Both variables overflow when the sum of parameter lengths becomes too large. This causes Npgsql to write a message size that is too small when constructing a Postgres protocol message to send it over the network to the database. When parsing the message, the database will only read a small number of bytes and treat any following bytes as new messages while they belong to the old message. Attackers can abuse this to inject arbitrary Postgres protocol messages into the connection, leading to the execution of arbitrary SQL statements on the application`s behalf. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.0.14, 4.1.13, 5.0.18, 6.0.11, 7.0.7, and 8.0.3. | [1]https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/commit/091655eed0c84e502ab424950c930339d17c1928<br>[2]https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/commit/3183efb2bdcca159c8c2e22af57e18ea8f853cf0<br>[3]https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/commit/67acbe027e28477ac2199e15cfb554bb2ffaf169<br>[4]https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/commit/703d9af8fa48dfe8c0180e36edb8278f34342d7b<br>[5]https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/commit/a22a42d8141d7a3528f43c02c095a409507cf1af<br>[6]https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/commit/e34e2ba8042e666d9af54a1b255fba4d5b11df56<br>[7]https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/commit/f7e7ead0702d776a8f551f5786c4cac2d65c4bc6<br>[8]https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/releases/tag/v4.0.14<br>[9]https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/releases/tag/v4.1.13<br>[10]https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/releases/tag/v5.0.18<br>[11]https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/releases/tag/v6.0.11<br>[12]https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/releases/tag/v7.0.7<br>[13]https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/releases/tag/v8.0.3<br>[14]https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/security/advisories/GHSA-x9vc-6hfv-hg8c |

For instance, the attacker can force the Administrator to add a new administrator controlled by the attacker, thereby giving the attacker full control over the application. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.1.9. | [1]https://github.com/froxlor/Froxlor/commit/a862307bce5cdfb1c208b835f3e8faddd23046e6<br>[2]https://github.com/froxlor/Froxlor/security/advisories/GHSA-x525-54hf-xr53 |
| 41 | CVE-2024-34077 | 7.3  | HIGH | MantisBT (Mantis Bug Tracker) is an open source issue tracker. Insufficient access control in the registration and password reset process allows an attacker to reset another user`s password and takeover their account, if the victim has an incomplete request pending. The exploit is only possible while the verification token is valid, i.e for 5 minutes after the confirmation URL sent by e-mail has been opened, and the user did not complete the process by updating their password. A brute-force attack calling account_update.php with increasing user IDs is possible. A successful takeover would grant the attacker full access to the compromised account, including sensitive information and functionalities associated with the account, the extent of which depends on its privileges and the data it has access to. Version 2.26.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may mitigate the risk by reducing the verification token`s validity (change the value of the `TOKEN_EXPIRY_AUTHENTICATED` constant in `constants_inc.php`). | [1]https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/92d11a01b195a1b6717a2f205218089158ea6d00<br>[2]https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/security/advisories/GHSA-93x3-m7pw-ppqm<br>[3]https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=34433 |
| 42 | CVE-2024-34340 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework. Prior to version 1.2.27, Cacti calls `compat_password_hash` when users set their password. `compat_password_hash` use `password_hash` if there is it, else use `md5`. When verifying password, it calls `compat_password_verify`. In `compat_password_verify`, `password_verify` is called if there is it, else use `md5`. `password_verify` and `password_hash` are supported on PHP < 5.5.0, following PHP manual. The vulnerability is in `compat_password_verify`. Md5-hashed user input is compared with correct password in database by `$md5 == $hash`. It is a loose comparison, not `===`. It is a type juggling vulnerability. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch for the issue. | [1]https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-37x7-mfjv-mm7m |

Prior to 13.5.1, an inconsistent interpretation of a crafted HTTP request meant that requests are treated as both a single request, and two separate requests by Next.js, leading to desynchronized responses. This led to a response queue poisoning vulnerability in the affected Next.js versions. For a request to be exploitable, the affected route also had to be making use of the [rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites) feature in Next.js.

The `__init__` constructor built in the `Llama` takes several parameters to configure the loading and running of the model. Other than `NUMA, LoRa settings`, `loading tokenizers,` and `hardware settings`, `__init__` also loads the `chat template` from targeted `.gguf` `s Metadata and furtherly parses it to `llama_chat_format.Jinja2ChatFormatter.to_chat_handler()` to construct the `self.chat_handler` for this model. Nevertheless, `Jinja2ChatFormatter` parse the `chat template` within the Metadate with sandbox-less `jinja2.Environment`, which is furthermore rendered in `__call__` to construct the `prompt` of interaction. This allows `jinja2` Server Side Template Injection which leads to remote code execution by a carefully constructed payload. | [1]https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python/commit/b454f40a9a1787b2b5659cd2cb00819d983185df<br>[2]https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python/security/advisories/GHSA-56xg-wfcc-g829 |

| 128 | CVE-2024-32977 | 7.1  | HIGH | OctoPrint provides a web interface for controlling consumer 3D printers. OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.10.0 contain a vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated attacker to completely bypass the authentication if the `autologinLocal` option is enabled within `config.yaml`, even if they come from networks that are not configured as `localNetworks`, spoofing their IP via the `X-Forwarded-For` header. If autologin is not enabled, this vulnerability does not have any impact. The vulnerability has been patched in version 1.10.1. Until the patch has been applied, OctoPrint administrators who have autologin enabled on their instances should disable it and/or to make the instance inaccessible from potentially hostile networks like the internet. | [1]https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/commit/5afbec8d23508edc25b0f1bdef1620580136add4<br>[2]https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/security/advisories/GHSA-2vjq-hg5w-5gm7 |

| 138 | CVE-2024-34714 | 7.6  | HIGH | The Hoppscotch Browser Extension is a browser extension for Hoppscotch, a community-driven end-to-end open-source API development ecosystem. Due to an oversight during a change made to the extension in the commit d4e8e4830326f46ba17acd1307977ecd32a85b58, a critical check for the origin list was missed and allowed for messages to be sent to the extension which the extension gladly processed and responded back with the results of, while this wasn`t supposed to happen and be blocked by the origin not being present in the origin list.This vulnerability exposes Hoppscotch Extension users to sites which call into Hoppscotch Extension APIs internally. This fundamentally allows any site running on the browser with the extension installed to bypass CORS restrictions if the user is running extensions with the given version. This security hole was patched in the commit 7e364b928ab722dc682d0fcad713a96cc38477d6 which was released along with the extension version `0.35`. As a workaround, Chrome users can use the Extensions Settings to disable the extension access to only the origins that you want. Firefox doesn`t have an alternative to upgrading to a fixed version. | [1]https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch-extension/commit/7e364b928ab722dc682d0fcad713a96cc38477d6<br>[2]https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch-extension/commit/d4e8e4830326f46ba17acd1307977ecd32a85b58<br>[3]https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch-extension/security/advisories/GHSA-jjh5-pvqx-gg5v<br>[4]https://server.yadhu.in/poc/hoppscotch-poc.html |

Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, repositories with submodules can be crafted in a way that exploits a bug in Git whereby it can be fooled into writing files not into the submodule`s worktree but into a `.git/` directory. This allows writing a hook that will be executed while the clone operation is still running, giving the user no opportunity to inspect the code that is being executed. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. If symbolic link support is disabled in Git (e.g. via `git config --global core.symlinks false`), the described attack won`t work.

| 190 | CVE-2024-32465 | 7.3  | HIGH | Git is a revision control system. The Git project recommends to avoid working in untrusted repositories, and instead to clone it first with `git clone --no-local` to obtain a clean copy. Git has specific protections to make that a safe operation even with an untrusted source repository, but vulnerabilities allow those protections to be bypassed. In the context of cloning local repositories owned by other users, this vulnerability has been covered in CVE-2024-32004. But there are circumstances where the fixes for CVE-2024-32004 are not enough: For example, when obtaining a `.zip` file containing a full copy of a Git repository, it should not be trusted by default to be safe, as e.g. hooks could be configured to run within the context of that repository. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4.

In versions 0.8.1 and prior, the unsafe handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may enable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the designated target folder. The routine `untarFile` attempts to guard against creating symbolic links that point outside the directory a tar archive is extracted to. However, a malicious tarball first linking `subdir/parent` to `..` (allowed, because `subdir/..` falls within the archive root) and then linking `subdir/parent/escapes` to `..` results in a symbolic link pointing to the tarball’s parent directory, contrary to the routine’s goals. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive file. Additionally, if the attacker has read access to the unpacked files, they may be able to read arbitrary system files the parent process has permissions to read. As of time of publication, no patch for this issue is available. | [1]https://github.com/dotmesh-io/dotmesh/blob/master/pkg/archiver/tar.go#L255<br>[2]https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2020-254-zipslip-dotmesh/ |
