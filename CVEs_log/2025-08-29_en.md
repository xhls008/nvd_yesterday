| 63 | CVE-2025-8067 | 8.5  | HIGH | A flaw was found in the Udisks daemon, where it allows unprivileged users to create loop devices using the D-BUS system. This is achieved via the loop device handler, which handles requests sent through the D-BUS interface. As two of the parameters of this handle, it receives the file descriptor list and index specifying the file where the loop device should be backed. The function itself validates the index value to ensure it isn`t bigger than the maximum value allowed. However, it fails to validate the lower bound, allowing the index parameter to be a negative value. Under these circumstances, an attacker can cause the UDisks daemon to crash or perform a local privilege escalation by gaining access to files owned by privileged users. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-8067<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2388623 |
| 64 | CVE-2025-57767 | 7.5  | HIGH | Asterisk is an open source private branch exchange and telephony toolkit. Prior to versions 20.15.2, 21.10.2, and 22.5.2, if a SIP request is received with an Authorization header that contains a realm that wasn`t in a previous 401 response`s WWW-Authenticate header, or an Authorization header with an incorrect realm was received without a previous 401 response being sent, the get_authorization_header() function in res_pjsip_authenticator_digest will return a NULL. This wasn`t being checked before attempting to get the digest algorithm from the header which causes a SEGV. This issue has been patched in versions 20.15.2, 21.10.2, and 22.5.2. There are no workarounds. | [1]https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/02993717b08f899d4aca9888062f35dfb198584f<br>[2]https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/pull/1407<br>[3]https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/security/advisories/GHSA-64qc-9x89-rx5j |

| 67 | CVE-2025-58048 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | Paymenter is a free and open-source webshop solution for hostings. Prior to version 1.2.11, the ticket attachments functionality in Paymenter allows a malicious authenticated user to upload arbitrary files. This could result in sensitive data extraction from the database, credentials being read from configuration files, and arbitrary system commands being run under the web server user context. This vulnerability was patched by commit 87c3db4 and was released under the version 1.2.11 tag without any other code modifications compared to version 1.2.10. If upgrading is not immediately possible, administrators can mitigate this vulnerability with one or more of the following measures: updating nginx config to download attachments instead of executing them or disallowing access to /storage/ fully using a WAF such as Cloudflare. | [1]https://github.com/Paymenter/Paymenter/commit/87c3db42282ada1e3cda54b9a01f846926c0669b<br>[2]https://github.com/Paymenter/Paymenter/releases/tag/v1.2.11<br>[3]https://github.com/Paymenter/Paymenter/security/advisories/GHSA-5pm9-r2m8-rcmj |
| 68 | CVE-2025-58059 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | Valtimo is a platform for Business Process Automation. In versions before 12.16.0.RELEASE, and from 13.0.0.RELEASE to before 13.1.2.RELEASE, any admin that can create or modify and execute process-definitions could gain access to sensitive data or resources. This includes but is not limited to: running executables on the application host, inspecting and extracting data from the host environment or application properties, spring beans (application context, database pooling). The following conditions have to be met in order to perform this attack: the user must be logged in, have the admin role, and must have some knowledge about running scripts via a the Camunda/Operator engine. Version 12.16.0 and 13.1.2 have been patched. It is strongly advised to upgrade. If no scripting is needed in any of the processes, it could be possible to disable it altogether via the ProcessEngineConfiguration. However, this workaround could lead to unexpected side-effects. | [1]https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-backend-libraries/commit/45eb60b0b2df5964fb9917295d0dceb1fff8dd85<br>[2]https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-backend-libraries/security/advisories/GHSA-w48j-pp7j-fj55 |
