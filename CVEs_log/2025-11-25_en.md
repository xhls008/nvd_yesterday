| 13 | CVE-2025-65998 | 7.5  | HIGH | Apache Syncope can be configured to store the user password values in the internal database with AES encryption, though this is not the default option.When AES is configured, the default key value, hard-coded in the source code, is always used. This allows a malicious attacker, once obtained access to the internal database content, to reconstruct the original cleartext password values.This is not affecting encrypted plain attributes, whose values are also stored using AES encryption.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.0.15 / 4.0.3, which fix this issue. | [1]https://lists.apache.org/thread/fjh0tb0d1xkbphc5ogdsc348ppz88cts<br>[2]http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/11/24/1 |
| 14 | CVE-2025-12970 | 8.8  | HIGH | The extract_name function in Fluent Bit in_docker input plugin copies container names into a fixed size stack buffer without validating length.

| 22 | CVE-2025-63434 | 8.8  | HIGH | The update mechanism in Xtooltech Xtool AnyScan Android Application 4.40.40 and prior is insecure. The application downloads and extracts update packages containing executable code without performing a cryptographic integrity or authenticity check on their contents. An attacker who can control the update metadata can serve a malicious package, which the application will accept, extract, and later execute, leading to arbitrary code execution. | [1]https://github.com/ab3lson/cve-references/tree/master/CVE-2025-63434<br>[2]https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2025/07/16/remote-code-execution-discovered-in-xtool-anyscan-app-risks-to-phones-and-vehicles/ |
| 23 | CVE-2025-63958 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | MILLENSYS Vision Tools Workspace 6.5.0.2585 exposes a sensitive configuration endpoint (/MILLENSYS/settings) that is accessible without authentication. This page leaks plaintext database credentials, file share paths, internal license server configuration, and software update parameters. An unauthenticated attacker can retrieve this information by accessing the endpoint directly, potentially leading to full system compromise. The vulnerability is due to missing access controls on a privileged administrative function. | [1]https://ozex.gitlab.io/tricks_hacks/2025-11-19-cve-2025-63958/index.html<br>[2]https://www.millensys.com/ |
| 24 | CVE-2025-13609 | 8.2  | HIGH | A vulnerability has been identified in keylime where an attacker can exploit this flaw by registering a new agent using a different Trusted Platform Module (TPM) device but claiming an existing agent`s unique identifier (UUID). This action overwrites the legitimate agent`s identity, enabling the attacker to impersonate the compromised agent and potentially bypass security controls. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-13609<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2416761 |
| 25 | CVE-2025-0005 | 7.3  | HIGH | Improper input validation within the XOCL driver may allow a local attacker to generate an integer overflow condition, potentially resulting in crash or denial of service. | [1]https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/AMD-SB-8014.html |
| 26 | CVE-2025-52539 | 7.3  | HIGH | A buffer overflow with Xilinx Run Time Environment may allow a local attacker to read or corrupt data from the advanced extensible interface (AXI), potentially resulting in loss of confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability. | [1]https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/AMD-SB-8014.html |
| 27 | CVE-2025-56400 | 8.8  | HIGH | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the OAuth implementation of the Tuya SDK 6.5.0 for Android and iOS, affects the Tuya Smart and Smartlife mobile applications, as well as other third-party applications that integrate the SDK, allows an attacker to link their own Amazon Alexa account to a victim`s Tuya account. The applications fail to validate the OAuth state parameter during the account linking flow, enabling a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)-like attack. By tricking the victim into clicking a crafted authorization link, an attacker can complete the OAuth flow on the victim`s behalf, resulting in unauthorized Alexa access to the victim`s Tuya-connected devices. This affects users regardless of prior Alexa linkage and does not require the Tuya application to be active at the time. Successful exploitation may allow remote control of devices such as cameras, doorbells, door locks, or alarms. | [1]http://tuya.com<br>[2]https://src.tuya.com/announcement/30 |
| 28 | CVE-2025-0003 | 7.3  | HIGH | Inadequate lock protection within Xilinx Run time may allow a local attacker to trigger a Use-After-Free condition potentially resulting in loss of confidentiality or availability | [1]https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/AMD-SB-8014.html |
| 29 | CVE-2025-48510 | 7.1  | HIGH | Improper return value within AMD uProf can allow a local attacker to bypass KSLR, potentially resulting in loss of confidentiality or availability. | [1]https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/AMD-SB-9019.html |
| 30 | CVE-2025-52538 | 8.0  | HIGH | Improper input validation within the XOCL driver may allow a local attacker to generate an integer overflow condition, potentially resulting in loss of confidentiality or availability. | [1]https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/AMD-SB-8014.html |
