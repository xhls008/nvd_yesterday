This is only exploitable when advanced mode is enabled on the site. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-malware-removal/tags/16.8/wpmr.php#L4570<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-malware-removal/tags/16.8/wpmr.php#L6304<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-malware-removal/tags/16.8/wpmr.php#L6401<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d44fe4d7-1af5-4e26-a33c-43a9cce4174c?source=cve |
| 6 | CVE-2025-7359 | 8.2  | HIGH | The Counter live visitors for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the wcvisitor_get_block function in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server. NOTE: This particular vulnerability deletes all the files in a targeted arbitrary directory rather than a specified arbitrary file, which can lead to loss of data or a denial of service condition. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/counter-visitor-for-woocommerce/tags/1.3.6/woo-counter-visitor.php#L378<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/ae13dc61-c4bf-4b17-8055-98c80a853a2a?source=cve |

The handler reads the client-supplied post_id and retrieves the corresponding email log post content (including the password-reset link), relying only on the ‘edit_posts’ capability without restricting to administrators or validating ownership. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to harvest an admin’s reset link and elevate their privileges to administrator. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ultimate-wp-mail/tags/1.3.6/includes/Ajax.class.php<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3328277<br>[3]https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-wp-mail/#developers<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b19794de-b623-4017-bd91-73986383c58b?source=cve |

| 59 | CVE-2025-40923 | 7.3  | HIGH | Plack-Middleware-Session before version 0.35 for Perl generates session ids insecurely.The default session id generator returns a SHA-1 hash seeded with the built-in rand function, the epoch time, and the PID. The PID will come from a small set of numbers, and the epoch time may be guessed, if it is not leaked from the HTTP Date header. The built-in rand function is unsuitable for cryptographic usage.Predicable session ids could allow an attacker to gain access to systems. | [1]https://github.com/plack/Plack-Middleware-Session/commit/1fbfbb355e34e7f4b3906f66cf958cedadd2b9be.patch<br>[2]https://github.com/plack/Plack-Middleware-Session/pull/52<br>[3]https://metacpan.org/release/MIYAGAWA/Plack-Middleware-Session-0.34/source/lib/Plack/Session/State.pm#L22<br>[4]https://security.metacpan.org/docs/guides/random-data-for-security.html |
| 60 | CVE-2025-40776 | 8.6  | HIGH | A `named` caching resolver that is configured to send ECS (EDNS Client Subnet) options may be vulnerable to a cache-poisoning attack.This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.11.3-S1 through 9.16.50-S1, 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.37-S1, and 9.20.9-S1 through 9.20.10-S1. | [1]https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2025-40776 |
| 61 | CVE-2025-53923 | 8.2  | HIGH | Emlog is an open source website building system. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in emlog up to and including pro-2.5.17 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the keyword parameter. Due to lack of sanitization it is possible to inject HTML/JS code into keyword parameter. If one persuades an user into clicking into prepared link it is possible to execute any JS code in admin`s browser. As of time of publication, no known patched versions exist. | [1]https://github.com/emlog/emlog/security/advisories/GHSA-vvx2-m94x-f54m |
| 62 | CVE-2025-32874 | 7.4  | HIGH | An issue was discovered in Kaseya Rapid Fire Tools Network Detective through 2.0.16.0. A vulnerability exists in the EncryptionUtil class because symmetric encryption is implemented in a deterministic and non-randomized fashion. The method Encrypt(byte[] clearData) derives both the encryption key and the IV from a fixed, hardcoded input by using a static salt value. As a result, identical plaintext inputs always produce identical ciphertext outputs. This is true for both FIPS and non-FIPS generated passwords. In other words, there is a cryptographic implementation flaw in the password encryption mechanism. Although there are multiple encryption methods grouped under FIPS and non-FIPS classifications, the logic consistently results in predictable and reversible encrypted outputs due to the lack of per-operation randomness and encryption authentication. | [1]https://codykretsinger.com<br>[2]https://galacticadvisors.com<br>[3]https://www.galacticadvisors.com/release/critical-vulnerabilities-in-network-detective/ |
