| 15 | CVE-2024-9289 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The WordPress & WooCommerce Affiliate Program plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 8.4.1. This is due to the rtwwwap_login_request_callback() function not properly validating a user`s identity prior to authenticating them to the site. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user, including administrators, granted they have access to the administrator`s email. | [1]https://codecanyon.net/item/wordpress-woocommerce-affiliate-program/23580333<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/ed19835f-2718-41d8-95af-47c8b9589529?source=cve |
| 16 | CVE-2024-41276 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | A vulnerability in Kaiten version 57.131.12 and earlier allows attackers to bypass the PIN code authentication mechanism.
