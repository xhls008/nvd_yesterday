| 1 | CVE-2024-38816 | 7.5  | HIGH | Applications serving static resources through the functional web frameworks WebMvc.fn or WebFlux.fn are vulnerable to path traversal attacks. An attacker can craft malicious HTTP requests and obtain any file on the file system that is also accessible to the process in which the Spring application is running.Specifically, an application is vulnerable when both of the following are true:  *  the web application uses RouterFunctions to serve static resources  *  resource handling is explicitly configured with a FileSystemResource locationHowever, malicious requests are blocked and rejected when any of the following is true:  *  the  Spring Security HTTP Firewall https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/exploits/firewall.html  is in use  *  the application runs on Tomcat or Jetty | [1]https://spring.io/security/cve-2024-38816 |
| 2 | CVE-2024-46673 | 7.8  | HIGH | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:scsi: aacraid: Fix double-free on probe failureaac_probe_one() calls hardware-specific init functions through theaac_driver_ident::init pointer, all of which eventually call down toaac_init_adapter().If aac_init_adapter() fails after allocating memory for aac_dev::queues,it frees the memory but does not clear that member.After the hardware-specific init function returns an error,aac_probe_one() goes down an error path that frees the memory pointed toby aac_dev::queues, resulting.in a double-free. | [1]https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4b540ec7c0045c2d01c4e479f34bbc8f147afa4c<br>[2]https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/564e1986b00c5f05d75342f8407f75f0a17b94df<br>[3]https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/60962c3d8e18e5d8dfa16df788974dd7f35bd87a<br>[4]https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/85449b28ff6a89c4513115e43ddcad949b5890c9<br>[5]https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8a3995a3ffeca280a961b59f5c99843d81b15929<br>[6]https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/919ddf8336f0b84c0453bac583808c9f165a85c2<br>[7]https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9e96dea7eff6f2bbcd0b42a098012fc66af9eb69<br>[8]https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d237c7d06ffddcdb5d36948c527dc01284388218 |

| 4 | CVE-2024-46683 | 7.8  | HIGH | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:drm/xe: prevent UAF around preempt fenceThe fence lock is part of the queue, therefore in the current designanything locking the fence should then also hold a ref to the queue toprevent the queue from being freed.However, currently it looks like we signal the fence and then drop thequeue ref, but if something is waiting on the fence, the waiter iskicked to wake up at some later point, where upon waking up it firstgrabs the lock before checking the fence state. But if we have alreadydropped the queue ref, then the lock might already be freed as part ofthe queue, leading to uaf.To prevent this, move the fence lock into the fence itself so we don`trun into lifetime issues. Alternative might be to have device levellock, or only release the queue in the fence release callback, howeverthat might require pushing to another worker to avoid locking issues.References: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/xe/kernel/-/issues/2454References: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/xe/kernel/-/issues/2342References: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/xe/kernel/-/issues/2020(cherry picked from commit 7116c35aacedc38be6d15bd21b2fc936eed0008b) | [1]https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/10081b0b0ed201f53e24bd92deb2e0f3c3e713d4<br>[2]https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/730b72480e29f63fd644f5fa57c9d46109428953 |

| 31 | CVE-2024-43099 | 8.8  | HIGH | The session hijacking attack targets the application layer`s control mechanism, which manages authenticated sessions between a host PC and a PLC. During such sessions, a session key is utilized to maintain security. However, if an attacker captures this session key, they can inject traffic into an ongoing authenticated session. To successfully achieve this, the attacker also needs to spoof both the IP address and MAC address of the originating host which is typical of a session-based attack. | [1]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-256-17 |
| 32 | CVE-2024-45368 | 8.8  | HIGH | The H2-DM1E PLC`s authentication protocol appears to utilize either a custom encoding scheme or a challenge-response protocol. However, there`s an observed anomaly in the H2-DM1E PLC`s protocol execution, namely its acceptance of multiple distinct packets as valid authentication responses. This behavior deviates from standard security practices where a single, specific response or encoding pattern is expected for successful authentication. | [1]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-256-17 |
| 33 | CVE-2024-39924 | 7.5  | HIGH | An issue was discovered in Vaultwarden (formerly Bitwarden_RS) 1.30.3. A vulnerability has been identified in the authentication and authorization process of the endpoint responsible for altering the metadata of an emergency access. It permits an attacker with granted emergency access to escalate their privileges by changing the access level and modifying the wait time. Consequently, the attacker can gain full control over the vault (when only intended to have read access) while bypassing the necessary wait period. | [1]https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/blob/1.30.3/src/api/core/emergency_access.rs#L115-L148<br>[2]https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/releases/tag/1.32.0 |
| 34 | CVE-2024-39925 | 7.5  | HIGH | An issue was discovered in Vaultwarden (formerly Bitwarden_RS) 1.30.3. It lacks an offboarding process for members who leave an organization. As a result, the shared organization key is not rotated when a member departs. Consequently, the departing member, whose access should be revoked, retains a copy of the organization key. Additionally, the application fails to adequately protect some encrypted data stored on the server. Consequently, an authenticated user could gain unauthorized access to encrypted data of any organization, even if the user is not a member of the targeted organization. However, the user would need to know the corresponding organizationId. Hence, if a user (whose access to an organization has been revoked) already possesses the organization key, that user could use the key to decrypt the leaked data. | [1]https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/releases<br>[2]https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/releases/tag/1.32.0 |
| 35 | CVE-2024-39926 | 7.5  | HIGH | An issue was discovered in Vaultwarden (formerly Bitwarden_RS) 1.30.3. A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) or, due to the default CSP, HTML injection vulnerability has been discovered in the admin dashboard. This potentially allows an authenticated attacker to inject malicious code into the dashboard, which is then executed or rendered in the context of an administrator`s browser when viewing the injected content. However, it is important to note that the default Content Security Policy (CSP) of the application blocks most exploitation paths, significantly mitigating the potential impact. | [1]https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/blob/1.30.3/src/static/scripts/admin_users.js#L201<br>[2]https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/releases/tag/1.32.0 |
