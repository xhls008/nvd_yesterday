| 1 | CVE-2025-55292 | 8.2  | HIGH | Meshtastic is an open source mesh networking solution. In the current Meshtastic architecture, a Node is identified by their NodeID, generated from the MAC address, rather than their public key. This aspect downgrades the security, specifically by abusing the HAM mode which doesn`t use encryption. An attacker can, as such, forge a NodeInfo on behalf of a victim node advertising that the HAM mode is enabled. This, in turn, will allow the other nodes on the mesh to accept the new information and overwriting the NodeDB. The other nodes will then only be able to send direct messages to the victim by using the shared channel key instead of the PKC. Additionally, because HAM mode by design doesn`t provide any confidentiality or authentication of information, the attacker could potentially also be able to change the Node details, like the full name, short code, etc. To keep the attack persistent, it is enough to regularly resend the forged NodeInfo, in particular right after the victim sends their own. A patch is available in version 2.7.6.834c3c5. | [1]https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/commit/e5e8683cdba133e726033101586c3235a8678893<br>[2]https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/security/advisories/GHSA-45vg-3f35-7ch2 |
| 2 | CVE-2025-67645 | 8.8  | HIGH | OpenEMR is a free and open source electronic health records and medical practice management application. Versions prior to 7.0.4 have a broken access control in the Profile Edit endpoint. An authenticated normal user can modify the request parameters (pubpid / pid) to reference another user’s record; the server accepts the modified IDs and applies the changes to that other user’s profile. This allows one user to alter another user’s profile data (name, contact info, etc.), and could enable account takeover. Version 7.0.4 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/openemr/openemr/commit/e2a682ee71aac71a9f04ae566f4ffca10052bc4a<br>[2]https://github.com/openemr/openemr/security/advisories/GHSA-vjmv-cf46-gffv |
| 3 | CVE-2026-23830 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | SandboxJS is a JavaScript sandboxing library. Versions prior to 0.8.26 have a sandbox escape vulnerability due to `AsyncFunction` not being isolated in `SandboxFunction`. The library attempts to sandbox code execution by replacing the global `Function` constructor with a safe, sandboxed version (`SandboxFunction`). This is handled in `utils.ts` by mapping `Function` to `sandboxFunction` within a map used for lookups. However, before version 0.8.26, the library did not include mappings for `AsyncFunction`, `GeneratorFunction`, and `AsyncGeneratorFunction`. These constructors are not global properties but can be accessed via the `.constructor` property of an instance (e.g., `(async () => {}).constructor`). In `executor.ts`, property access is handled. When code running inside the sandbox accesses `.constructor` on an async function (which the sandbox allows creating), the `executor` retrieves the property value. Since `AsyncFunction` was not in the safe-replacement map, the `executor` returns the actual native host `AsyncFunction` constructor. Constructors for functions in JavaScript (like `Function`, `AsyncFunction`) create functions that execute in the global scope. By obtaining the host `AsyncFunction` constructor, an attacker can create a new async function that executes entirely outside the sandbox context, bypassing all restrictions and gaining full access to the host environment (Remote Code Execution). Version 0.8.26 patches this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/nyariv/SandboxJS/commit/345aee6566e47979dee5c337b925b141e7f78ccd<br>[2]https://github.com/nyariv/SandboxJS/security/advisories/GHSA-wxhw-j4hc-fmq6 |

| 59 | CVE-2026-24772 | 8.9  | HIGH | OpenProject is an open-source, web-based project management software. To enable the real time collaboration on documents, OpenProject 17.0 introduced a synchronization server. The OpenPrioject backend generates an authentication token that is currently valid for 24 hours, encrypts it with a shared secret only known to the synchronization server. The frontend hands this encrypted token and the backend URL over to the synchronization server to check user`s ability to work on the document and perform intermittent saves while editing. The synchronization server does not properly validate the backend URL and sends a request with the decrypted authentication token to the endpoint that was given to the server. An attacker could use this vulnerability to decrypt a token that he intercepted by other means to gain an access token to interact with OpenProject on the victim`s behalf. This vulnerability was introduced with OpenProject 17.0.0 and was fixed in 17.0.2. As a workaround, disable the collaboration feature via Settings -> Documents -> Real time collaboration -> Disable. Additionally the `hocuspocus` container should also be disabled. | [1]https://github.com/opf/openproject/security/advisories/GHSA-r854-p5qj-x974 |
