In versions from 0.31.0 to 1.1.0, the EMOJI_REGEX used in the emoji action is vulnerable to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. A short, maliciously crafted string (e.g., <100 characters) can cause the regex engine to consume excessive CPU time (minutes), leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the application. This issue has been patched in version 1.2.0. | [1]https://github.com/open-circle/valibot/commit/cfb799db301a953a0950d5c05a34a3ab121262dc<br>[2]https://github.com/open-circle/valibot/security/advisories/GHSA-vqpr-j7v3-hqw9 |
| 4 | CVE-2025-66022 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | FACTION is a PenTesting Report Generation and Collaboration Framework. Prior to version 1.7.1, an extension execution path in Faction’s extension framework permits untrusted extension code to execute arbitrary system commands on the server when a lifecycle hook is invoked, resulting in remote code execution (RCE) on the host running Faction. Due to a missing authentication check on the /portal/AppStoreDashboard endpoint, an attacker can access the extension management UI and upload a malicious extension without any authentication, making this vulnerability exploitable by unauthenticated users. This issue has been patched in version 1.7.1. | [1]https://github.com/factionsecurity/faction/commit/c6389f1c76175b7c1c68d1a87b389311b16c62c3<br>[2]https://github.com/factionsecurity/faction/security/advisories/GHSA-xr72-2g43-586w<br>[3]https://github.com/factionsecurity/faction/security/advisories/GHSA-xr72-2g43-586w |

| 9 | CVE-2025-59390 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Apache Druid’s Kerberos authenticator uses a weak fallback secret when the `druid.auth.authenticator.kerberos.cookieSignatureSecret` configuration is not explicitly set. In this case, the secret is generated using `ThreadLocalRandom`, which is not a crypto-graphically secure random number generator. This may allow an attacker to predict or brute force the secret used to sign authentication cookies, potentially enabling token forgery or authentication bypass. Additionally, each process generates its own fallback secret, resulting in inconsistent secrets across nodes. This causes authentication failures in distributed or multi-broker deployments, effectively leading to a incorrectly configured clusters. Users are advised to configure a strong `druid.auth.authenticator.kerberos.cookieSignatureSecret`This issue affects Apache Druid: through 34.0.0.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 35.0.0, which fixes the issue making it mandatory to set `druid.auth.authenticator.kerberos.cookieSignatureSecret` when using the Kerberos authenticator. Services will fail to come up if the secret is not set. | [1]https://lists.apache.org/thread/jwjltllnntgj1sb9wzsjmvwm9f8rlhg8<br>[2]http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/11/26/1 |
| 10 | CVE-2025-13601 | 7.7  | HIGH | A heap-based buffer overflow problem was found in glib through an incorrect calculation of buffer size in the g_escape_uri_string() function. If the string to escape contains a very large number of unacceptable characters (which would need escaping), the calculation of the length of the escaped string could overflow, leading to a potential write off the end of the newly allocated string. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-13601<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2416741<br>[3]https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/issues/3827<br>[4]https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/merge_requests/4914 |

| 19 | CVE-2025-64330 | 7.5  | HIGH | Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open Information Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. Prior to versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2, a single byte read heap overflow when logging the verdict in eve.alert and eve.drop records can lead to crashes. This requires the per packet alert queue to be filled with alerts and then followed by a pass rule. This issue has been patched in versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2. To reduce the likelihood of this issue occurring, the alert queue size a should be increased (packet-alert-max in suricata.yaml) if verdict is enabled. | [1]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/482e5eac9218d007adbe2410d6c00173368ce947<br>[2]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-83v7-gm34-f437 |
| 20 | CVE-2025-64331 | 7.5  | HIGH | Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open Information Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. Prior to versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2, a stack overflow can occur on large HTTP file transfers if the user has increased the HTTP response body limit and enabled the logging of printable http bodies. This issue has been patched in versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2. A workaround for this issue involves using default HTTP response body limits and/or disabling http-body-printable logging; body logging is disabled by default. | [1]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-v32w-j79x-pfj2 |
| 21 | CVE-2025-64332 | 7.5  | HIGH | Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open Information Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. Prior to versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2, a stack overflow that causes Suricata to crash can occur if SWF decompression is enabled. This issue has been patched in versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2. A workaround for this issue involves disabling SWF decompression (swf-decompression in suricata.yaml), it is disabled by default; set decompress-depth to lower than half your stack size if swf-decompression must be enabled. | [1]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/ad446c9006a77490af51c468aae0ce934f4d2117<br>[2]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-p32q-7wcp-gv92 |
