| 1 | CVE-2025-11923 | 8.8  | HIGH | The LifterLMS – WP LMS for eLearning, Online Courses, & Quizzes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user`s identity prior to allowing them to modify their own role via the REST API. The permission check in the update_item_permissions_check() function returns true when a user updates their own account without verifying the role changes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with student-level access and above, to escalate their privileges to administrator by updating their own roles array via a crafted REST API request. Another endpoint intended for instructors also provides an attack vector. Affected version ranges are 3.5.3-3.41.2, 4.0.0-4.21.3, 5.0.0-5.10.0, 6.0.0-6.11.0, 7.0.0-7.8.7, 8.0.0-8.0.7, 9.0.0-9.0.7, 9.1.0. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/lifterlms/trunk/libraries/lifterlms-rest/includes/abstracts/class-llms-rest-users-controller.php#L721<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/lifterlms/trunk/libraries/lifterlms-rest/includes/server/class-llms-rest-students-controller.php#L386<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3393703%40lifterlms%2Ftrunk&old=3388956%40lifterlms%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/cc13d13c-6b79-4bf1-8e77-c8cb836dc0c5?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2025-12733 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Import any XML, CSV or Excel File to WordPress (WP All Import) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.6. This is due to the use of eval() on unsanitized user-supplied input in the pmxi_if function within helpers/functions.php. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with import capabilities (typically administrators), to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server via crafted import templates. This can lead to remote code execution. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-all-import/tags/3.9.6/helpers/functions.php#L79<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3393968%40wp-all-import&new=3393968%40wp-all-import&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/8475dd90-b47a-42b4-8e4e-44e8512e4fca?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2025-12844 | 7.1  | HIGH | The AI Engine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection via PHAR Deserialization in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.8 via deserialization of untrusted input in the `rest_simpleTranscribeAudio` and `rest_simpleVisionQuery` functions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present. | [1]https://github.com/jordymeow/ai-engine/blob/main/classes/api.php#L799<br>[2]https://github.com/jordymeow/ai-engine/blob/main/classes/engines/chatml.php#L960-L967<br>[3]https://github.com/jordymeow/ai-engine/blob/main/classes/modules/files.php#L237<br>[4]https://github.com/jordymeow/ai-engine/blob/main/classes/services/image.php#L43<br>[5]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3392052/<br>[6]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c39c1b72-e3e0-44fb-8fb8-602cb0aa61e3?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2025-12762 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | pgAdmin versions up to 9.9 are affected by a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability that occurs when running in server mode and performing restores from PLAIN-format dump files. This issue allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting pgAdmin, posing a critical risk to the integrity and security of the database management system and underlying data. | [1]https://github.com/pgadmin-org/pgadmin4/issues/9320 |
| 5 | CVE-2025-12764 | 7.5  | HIGH | pgAdmin <= 9.9  is affected by an LDAP injection vulnerability in the LDAP authentication flow that allows an attacker to inject special LDAP characters in the username, causing the DC/LDAP server and the client to process an unusual amount of data DOS. | [1]https://github.com/pgadmin-org/pgadmin4/issues/9325 |

| 12 | CVE-2025-60690 | 8.8  | HIGH | A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the get_merge_ipaddr function of the httpd binary on Linksys E1200 v2 routers (Firmware E1200_v2.0.11.001_us.tar.gz). The function concatenates up to four user-supplied CGI parameters matching <parameter>_0~3 into a fixed-size buffer (a2) without bounds checking. Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability via specially crafted HTTP requests to execute arbitrary code or cause denial of service without authentication. | [1]http://linksys.com<br>[2]https://github.com/yifan20020708/SGTaint-0-day/blob/main/Linksys/Linksys-E1200/CVE-2025-60690.md<br>[3]https://www.linksys.com/ |
| 13 | CVE-2025-60691 | 8.8  | HIGH | A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the httpd binary of Linksys E1200 v2 routers (Firmware E1200_v2.0.11.001_us.tar.gz). The apply_cgi and block_cgi functions copy user-supplied input from the "url" CGI parameter into stack buffers (v36, v29) using sprintf without bounds checking. Because these buffers are allocated as single-byte variables, any non-empty input will trigger a buffer overflow. Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability via crafted HTTP requests to execute arbitrary code or cause denial of service without authentication. | [1]http://linksys.com<br>[2]https://github.com/yifan20020708/SGTaint-0-day/blob/main/Linksys/Linksys-E1200/CVE-2025-60691.md<br>[3]https://www.linksys.com/ |
| 14 | CVE-2025-60692 | 8.4  | HIGH | A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the libshared.so library of Cisco Linksys E1200 v2 routers (Firmware E1200_v2.0.11.001_us.tar.gz). The functions get_mac_from_ip and get_ip_from_mac use sscanf with overly permissive "%100s" format specifiers to parse entries from /proc/net/arp into fixed-size buffers (v6: 50 bytes, v7 sub-arrays: 50 bytes). This allows local attackers controlling the contents of /proc/net/arp to overflow stack buffers, leading to memory corruption, denial of service, or potential arbitrary code execution. | [1]http://linksys.com<br>[2]https://github.com/yifan20020708/SGTaint-0-day/blob/main/Linksys/Linksys-E1200/CVE-2025-60692.md<br>[3]https://www.linksys.com/ |
| 15 | CVE-2025-60694 | 7.5  | HIGH | A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the validate_static_route function of the httpd binary on Linksys E1200 v2 routers (Firmware E1200_v2.0.11.001_us.tar.gz). The function improperly concatenates user-supplied CGI parameters (route_ipaddr_0~3, route_netmask_0~3, route_gateway_0~3) into fixed-size buffers (v6, v10, v14) without proper bounds checking. Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability via specially crafted HTTP requests to execute arbitrary code or cause denial of service without authentication. | [1]http://linksys.com<br>[2]https://github.com/yifan20020708/SGTaint-0-day/blob/main/Linksys/Linksys-E1200/CVE-2025-60694.md<br>[3]https://www.linksys.com/ |
| 16 | CVE-2025-60696 | 8.4  | HIGH | A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the makeRequest.cgi binary of Linksys RE7000 routers (Firmware FW_v2.0.15_211230_1012). The arplookup function parses lines from /proc/net/arp using sscanf("%16s ... %18s ..."), storing results into buffers v6 (12 bytes) and v7 (20 bytes). Since the format specifiers allow up to 16 and 18 bytes respectively, oversized input can overflow the buffers, resulting in stack corruption. Local attackers controlling /proc/net/arp contents can exploit this issue to cause denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code. | [1]http://linksys.com<br>[2]https://github.com/yifan20020708/SGTaint-0-day/blob/main/Linksys/Linksys-RE700/CVE-2025-60696.md<br>[3]https://www.linksys.com/ |
| 17 | CVE-2025-13122 | 7.3  | HIGH | A vulnerability was detected in SourceCodester Patients Waiting Area Queue Management System 1.0. The affected element is the function getPatientAppointment of the file /php/api_patient_checkin.php. Performing manipulation of the argument appointmentID results in sql injection. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit is now public and may be used. | [1]https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.332350<br>[2]https://vuldb.com/?id.332350<br>[3]https://vuldb.com/?submit.683789<br>[4]https://www.sourcecodester.com/ |
| 18 | CVE-2025-60697 | 7.3  | HIGH | A command injection vulnerability exists in the D-Link DIR-882 Router firmware DIR882A1_FW102B02 within the `prog.cgi` and `rc` binaries. The `sub_4438A4` function in `prog.cgi` stores user-supplied DDNS parameters (`ServerAddress` and `Hostname`) in NVRAM via `nvram_safe_set`. These values are later retrieved in the `start_DDNS_ipv4` function of `rc` using `nvram_safe_get` and concatenated into DDNS shell commands executed via `twsystem()` without proper sanitization. Partial string comparison is performed but is insufficient to prevent command injection. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the device through specially crafted HTTP requests to the router`s web interface. | [1]https://github.com/yifan20020708/SGTaint-0-day/blob/main/DLink/DLink-DIR-882/4.md<br>[2]https://github.com/yifan20020708/SGTaint-0-day/blob/main/DLink/DLink-DIR-882/CVE-2025-60697.md<br>[3]https://www.dlink.com/<br>[4]https://www.dlink.com/en/security-bulletin/ |
| 19 | CVE-2025-60698 | 7.3  | HIGH | A command injection vulnerability exists in the D-Link DIR-882 Router firmware DIR882A1_FW102B02 within the `prog.cgi` and `rc` binaries. The `sub_432F60` function in `prog.cgi` stores user-supplied `SetSysLogSettings/IPAddress` values in NVRAM via `nvram_safe_set("SysLogRemote_IPAddress", ...)`. These values are later retrieved in the `sub_448DCC` function of `rc` using `nvram_safe_get` and concatenated into a shell command executed via `twsystem()` without any sanitization. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the device through specially crafted HTTP requests to the router`s web interface. | [1]https://github.com/yifan20020708/SGTaint-0-day/blob/main/DLink/DLink-DIR-882/2.md<br>[2]https://github.com/yifan20020708/SGTaint-0-day/blob/main/DLink/DLink-DIR-882/CVE-2025-60698.md<br>[3]https://www.dlink.com/<br>[4]https://www.dlink.com/en/security-bulletin/ |

| 23 | CVE-2025-59840 | 8.1  | HIGH | Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. In Vega prior to version 6.2.0, applications meeting 2 conditions are at risk of arbitrary JavaScript code execution, even if "safe mode" expressionInterpreter is used. They are vulnerable if they use `vega` in an application that attaches `vega` library and a `vega.View` instance similar to the Vega Editor to the global `window` and if they allow user-defined Vega `JSON` definitions (vs JSON that was is only provided through source code). Patches are available in the following Vega applications. If using the latest Vega line (6.x), upgrade to `vega` `6.2.0` / `vega-expression` `6.1.0` / `vega-interpreter`  `2.2.1` (if using AST evaluator mode). If using Vega in a non-ESM environment, upgrade to `vega-expression` `5.2.1` / `1.2.1` (if using AST evaluator mode). Some workarounds are available. Do not attach `vega` View instances to global variables, and do not attach `vega` to the global window. These practices of attaching the vega library and View instances may be convenient for debugging, but should not be used in production or in any situation where vega/vega-lite definitions could be provided by untrusted parties. | [1]https://github.com/vega/vega/security/advisories/GHSA-7f2v-3qq3-vvjf |
| 24 | CVE-2025-64709 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | Typebot is an open-source chatbot builder. In versions prior to 3.13.1, a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the Typebot webhook block (HTTP Request component) functionality allows authenticated users to make arbitrary HTTP requests from the server, including access to AWS Instance Metadata Service (IMDS). By bypassing IMDSv2 protection through custom header injection, attackers can extract temporary AWS IAM credentials for the EKS node role, leading to complete compromise of the Kubernetes cluster and associated AWS infrastructure. Version 3.13.1 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/security/advisories/GHSA-8gq9-rw7v-3jpr |
| 25 | CVE-2025-13130 | 7.8  | HIGH | A vulnerability has been found in Radarr 5.28.0.10274. The affected element is an unknown function of the file C:\ProgramData\Radarr\bin\Radarr.Console.exe of the component Service. Such manipulation leads to incorrect default permissions. The attack can only be performed from a local environment. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way. | [1]https://github.com/lakshayyverma/CVE-Discovery/blob/main/Radarr.md<br>[2]https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.332361<br>[3]https://vuldb.com/?id.332361<br>[4]https://vuldb.com/?submit.683876 |
| 26 | CVE-2025-13131 | 7.8  | HIGH | A vulnerability was found in Sonarr 4.0.15.2940. The impacted element is an unknown function of the file C:\ProgramData\Sonarr\bin\Sonarr.Console.exe of the component Service. Performing manipulation results in incorrect default permissions. The attack is only possible with local access. The vendor confirms this vulnerability but classifies it as a "low severity issue due to the default service user being used as it would either require someone to intentionally change the service to a highly privileged account or an attacker would need an admin level account". It is planned to fix this issue in the next major release v5. | [1]https://github.com/lakshayyverma/CVE-Discovery/blob/main/Sonarr.md<br>[2]https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.332362<br>[3]https://vuldb.com/?id.332362<br>[4]https://vuldb.com/?submit.683894 |

| 32 | CVE-2025-64530 | 7.5  | HIGH | Apollo Federation is an architecture for declaratively composing APIs into a unified graph. A vulnerability in versions of Apollo Federation`s composition logic prior to 2.9.5, 2.10.4, 2.11.5, and 2.12.1 allowed some queries to Apollo Router to improperly bypass access controls on types/fields. Apollo Federation incorrectly allowed user-defined access control directives on interface types/fields, which could be bypassed by instead querying the implementing object types/fields in Apollo Router via inline fragments, for example. A fix to versions 2.9.5, 2.10.4, 2.11.5, and 2.12.1 of composition logic in Federation now disallows interfaces types and fields to contain user-defined access control directives. Some workarounds are available. Users of Apollo Rover with an unpatched composition version or are using the Apollo Studio build pipeline with Federation version 2.8 or below should manually copy the access control requirements on interface types/fields to each implementing object type/field where appropriate. Do not remove those access control requirements from the interface types/fields, as unpatched Apollo Composition will not automatically generate them in the supergraph schema. Customers not using Apollo Router access control features (`@authenticated`, `@requiresScopes`, or `@policy` directives) or not specifying access control requirements on interface types/fields are not affected and do not need to take action. | [1]https://github.com/apollographql/federation/security/advisories/GHSA-mx7m-j9xf-62hw |
