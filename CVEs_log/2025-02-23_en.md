| No. | CVE ID | Base Score | Severity | Description | References |
|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2024-13899 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Mambo Importer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.0 via deserialization of untrusted input via the $data parameter in the fImportMenu function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/mambo-joomla-importer/trunk/mamboImporter.php#L45<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b6d448c2-5acc-47f8-8e86-9ef10fa01513?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2025-1509 | 7.3  | HIGH | The The Show Me The Cookies plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. | [1]https://wordpress.org/plugins/show-me-the-cookies/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/65d15ceb-ab39-4088-a289-7244063aedf8?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2025-1510 | 7.3  | HIGH | The The Custom Post Type Date Archives plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.1. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. | [1]https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-date-archives/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/996ade9c-2531-4f43-87f6-eddb2ce98a12?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2024-13474 | 7.5  | HIGH | The LTL Freight Quotes – Purolator Edition plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the `dropship_edit_id` and `edit_id` parameters in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.3 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3244300%40ltl-freight-quotes-purolator-freight-edition&new=3244300%40ltl-freight-quotes-purolator-freight-edition&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/2db0b8c9-7908-484d-9a02-1c50f88efdd0?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2025-1361 | 7.5  | HIGH | The IP2Location Country Blocker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Regular Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 2.38.8 due to missing capability checks on the admin_init() function.

| 6 | CVE-2024-13869 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Migration, Backup, Staging – WPvivid Backup & Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the `upload_files` function in all versions up to, and including, 0.9.112. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. NOTE: Uploaded files are only accessible on WordPress instances running on the NGINX web server as the existing .htaccess within the target file upload folder prevents access on Apache servers. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3242904/wpvivid-backuprestore<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0082e46d-fdbe-4ab7-bba3-0681a25d4495?source=cve |
