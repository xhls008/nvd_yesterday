|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2024-2385 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Elementor Addons by Livemesh plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 8.3.7 via several of the plugin`s widgets through the `style` attribute. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/addons-for-elementor/tags/8.3.5/includes/helper-functions.php#L726<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/addons-for-elementor/tags/8.3.5/includes/widgets/heading.php#L267<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0aa3ec9b-80d5-4e31-8045-43c8d151cab8?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2024-1182 | 7.0  | HIGH | Uncontrolled Search Path Element vulnerability in ICONICS GENESIS64 all versions, Mitsubishi Electric GENESIS64 all versions and Mitsubishi Electric MC Works64 all versions allows a local attacker to execute a malicious code by storing a specially crafted DLL in a specific folder when GENESIS64 and MC Works64 are installed with the Pager agent in the alarm multi-agent notification feature. | [1]https://jvn.jp/vu/JVNVU98894016/<br>[2]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-184-03<br>[3]https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2024-004_en.pdf |
| 3 | CVE-2024-3904 | 8.8  | HIGH | Incorrect Default Permissions vulnerability in Smart Device Communication Gateway preinstalled on MELIPC Series MI5122-VW firmware versions "05" to "07" allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code by saving a malicious file to a specific folder. As a result, the attacker may disclose, tamper with, destroy or delete information in the product, or cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the product. | [1]https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2024-003_en.pdf |
| 4 | CVE-2024-6318 | 8.8  | HIGH | The IMGspider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the `upload_img_file` function in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.10. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level and above permissions, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/imgspider/tags/2.3.10/classes/post.class.php#L122<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3107741/imgspider<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/306f00e4-9a70-48be-a91e-e396643a8129?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2024-6319 | 8.8  | HIGH | The IMGspider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the `upload` function in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.10. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level and above permissions, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/imgspider/tags/2.3.10/classes/post.class.php#L189<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3107741/imgspider<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/63a4a077-c99e-4742-9fa1-f323fd24b950?source=cve |
| 6 | CVE-2024-5943 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Nested Pages plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the `settingsPage` function and missing santization of the `tab` parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to call local php files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-nested-pages/trunk/app/Config/Settings.php#L129<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-nested-pages/trunk/app/Views/settings/settings.php#L20<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3111847/<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c2663150-61f9-49e3-9219-fbe89cc6b03c?source=cve |
