| 5 | CVE-2024-9488 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Comments – wpDiscuz plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 7.6.24. This is due to insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the email and the user does not have an already-existing account for the service returning the token. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpdiscuz/trunk/forms/wpdFormAttr/Login/SocialLogin.php<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3164486/<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b71706a7-e101-4d50-a2da-1aeeaf07cf4b?source=cve |
| 6 | CVE-2024-10011 | 8.1  | HIGH | The BuddyPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 14.1.0 via the id parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to perform actions on files outside of the originally intended directory and enables file uploads to directories outside of the web root. Depending on server configuration it may be possible to upload files with double extensions. This vulnerability only affects Windows. | [1]https://codex.buddypress.org/releases/version-14-2-1/<br>[2]https://github.com/buddypress/buddypress/blob/master/src/bp-core/bp-core-avatars.php#L1270<br>[3]https://github.com/buddypress/buddypress/blob/master/src/bp-core/bp-core-avatars.php#L1370<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3173924/buddypress/trunk/bp-core/bp-core-avatars.php?contextall=1&old=3102524&old_path=%2Fbuddypress%2Ftrunk%2Fbp-core%2Fbp-core-avatars.php<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/4327f414-64f4-4193-a5c0-2a5ecdd75e11?source=cve |

| 8 | CVE-2024-9235 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Mapster WP Maps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to an insufficient capability check on the mapster_wp_maps_set_option_from_js() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site. | [1]https://github.com/WordPressBugBounty/plugins-mapster-wp-maps/blob/009ff350f7fee0788c6d8a735af03e21b132c983/mapster-wp-maps/admin/api/class-mapster-wordpress-maps-api.php#L12<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3161051/mapster-wp-maps/tags/1.5.0/admin/api/class-mapster-wordpress-maps-api.php?old=3154048&old_path=mapster-wp-maps%2Ftags%2F1.4.1%2Fadmin%2Fapi%2Fclass-mapster-wordpress-maps-api.php<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3173973<br>[4]https://wordpress.org/plugins/mapster-wp-maps/<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b81c2990-68d1-4d45-9724-262ec017caf1?source=cve |
| 9 | CVE-2024-9302 | 8.1  | HIGH | The App Builder – Create Native Android & iOS Apps On The Flight plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 5.3.7. This is due to the verify_otp_forgot_password() and update_password() functions not having enough controls to prevent a successful brute force attack of the OTP to change a password, or verify that a password reset request came from an authorized user. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to generate and brute force an OTP that makes it possible to change any users passwords, including an administrator. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/app-builder/tags/5.3.1/includes/Di/Service/Auth/ForgotPassword.php#L196<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/app-builder/tags/5.3.1/includes/Di/Service/Auth/ForgotPassword.php#L247<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3161215/<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0eb9d676-4fa0-4bdc-af44-5d7e1dd8c6e6?source=cve |

| 33 | CVE-2024-47821 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | pyLoad is a free and open-source Download Manager. The folder `/.pyload/scripts` has scripts which are run when certain actions are completed, for e.g. a download is finished. By downloading a executable file to a folder in /scripts and performing the respective action, remote code execution can be achieved in versions on the 0.5 branch prior to 0.5.0b3.dev87. A file can be downloaded to such a folder by changing the download folder to a folder in `/scripts` path and using the `/flashgot` API to download the file. This vulnerability allows an attacker with access to change the settings on a pyload server to execute arbitrary code and completely compromise the system. Version 0.5.0b3.dev87 fixes this issue. | [1]https://github.com/pyload/pyload/security/advisories/GHSA-w7hq-f2pj-c53g |
