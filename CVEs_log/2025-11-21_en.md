| 11 | CVE-2025-60738 | 7.5  | HIGH | An issue in Ilevia EVE X1 Server Firmware Version v4.7.18.0.eden and before Logic Version v6.00 - 2025_07_21 and before allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the ping.php component does not perform secure filtering on IP parameters | [1]https://github.com/iSee857/ilevia-EVE-X1-Server |
| 12 | CVE-2025-12120 | 7.3  | HIGH | Lite XL versions 2.1.8 and prior automatically execute the .lite_project.lua file when opening a project directory, without prompting the user for confirmation. The .lite_project.lua file is intended for project-specific configuration but can contain executable Lua logic. This behavior could allow execution of untrusted Lua code if a user opens a malicious project, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the Lite XL process. | [1]https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/2164<br>[2]https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/579478 |
| 13 | CVE-2025-12121 | 7.3  | HIGH | Lite XL versions 2.1.8 and prior contain a vulnerability in the system.exec function, which allowed arbitrary command execution through unsanitized shell command construction. This function was used in project directory launching (core.lua), drag-and-drop file handling (rootview.lua), and the “open in system” command in the treeview plugin (treeview.lua). If an attacker could influence input to system.exec, they might execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the Lite XL process. | [1]https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl/pull/2163<br>[2]https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/579478 |

| 18 | CVE-2025-63807 | 7.5  | HIGH | An issue was discovered in weijiang1994 university-bbs (aka Blogin) in commit 9e06bab430bfc729f27b4284ba7570db3b11ce84 (2025-01-13). A weak verification code generation mechanism combined with missing rate limiting allows attackers to perform brute-force attacks on verification codes without authentication. Successful exploitation may result in account takeover via password reset or other authentication bypass methods. | [1]https://gist.github.com/Rycarl-Furry/3e93c6f0d48a29518adf341e0fc7e2dd |
