|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2025-0357 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The WPBookit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type validation in the `WPB_Profile_controller::handle_image_upload` function in versions up to, and including, 1.6.9. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://documentation.iqonic.design/wpbookit/versions/change-log<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/19bf7a68-e76d-4740-9f35-b6084094f59b?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2025-0682 | 8.8  | HIGH | The ThemeREX Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 2.33.0 via the `trx_sc_reviews` shortcode `type` attribute. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level and above permissions, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where php file type can be uploaded and included. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/qwery-multipurpose-business-wordpress-theme/29678687<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/15a9718f-f877-4e33-8f7a-950791c4ca85?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2024-12600 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Custom Product Tabs Lite for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.0 via deserialization of untrusted input from the `frs_woo_product_tabs` parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Shop Manager-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woocommerce-custom-product-tabs-lite/trunk/woocommerce-custom-product-tabs-lite.php#L372<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3226839/<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/33c16b47-3202-4f26-bf45-98172b8cac45?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2024-13562 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Import WP â€“ Export and Import CSV and XML files to WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 2.14.5 via the uploads directory. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data  stored insecurely in the /wp-content/uploads/ directory which can contain information like imported or local user data and files. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3226495/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d6d69ffd-bb39-4fcc-9444-27d1a901e7c9?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2024-39750 | 8.8  | HIGH | IBM Analytics Content Hub 2.0 is vulnerable to a buffer overflow due to improper return length checking. A remote authenticated attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the server to crash. | [1]https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/7172787 |
| 6 | CVE-2025-0542 | 7.8  | HIGH | Local privilege escalation due to incorrect assignment of privileges of temporary files in the update mechanism of G DATA Management Server. This vulnerability allows a local, unprivileged attacker to escalate privileges on affected installations by placing a crafted ZIP archive in a globally writable directory, which gets unpacked in the context of SYSTEM and results in arbitrary file write. | [1]https://github.com/nullby73/security-advisories/tree/main/CVE-2025-0542 |
| 7 | CVE-2025-0543 | 7.8  | HIGH | Local privilege escalation in G DATA Security Client due to incorrect assignment of privileges to directories. This vulnerability allows a local, unprivileged attacker to escalate privileges on affected installations by placing an arbitrary executable in a globally writable directory resulting in execution by the SetupSVC.exe service in the context of SYSTEM. | [1]https://github.com/nullby73/security-advisories/tree/main/CVE-2025-0543 |
