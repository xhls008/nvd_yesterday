|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2024-7457 | 7.8  | HIGH | The ws.stash.app.mac.daemon.helper tool contains a vulnerability caused by an incorrect use of macOS’s authorization model. Instead of validating the client`s authorization reference, the helper invokes AuthorizationCopyRights() using its own privileged context (root), effectively authorizing itself rather than the client. As a result, it grants the system.preferences.admin right internally, regardless of the requesting client`s privileges. This flawed logic allows unprivileged clients to invoke privileged operations via XPC, including unauthorized changes to system-wide network preferences such as SOCKS, HTTP, and HTTPS proxy settings. The absence of proper code-signing checks further enables arbitrary processes to exploit this flaw, leading to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks through traffic redirection. | [1]https://pentraze.com/ |
| 2 | CVE-2024-9062 | 7.8  | HIGH | The Archify application contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability due to insufficient client validation in its privileged helper tool, com.oct4pie.archifyhelper, which is exposed via XPC. Archify follows the "factored applications" model, delegating privileged operations—such as arbitrary file deletion and file permission changes—to this helper running as root. However, the helper does not verify the code signature, entitlements, or signing flags of the connecting client. Although macOS provides secure validation mechanisms like auditToken, these are not implemented. As a result, any local process can establish a connection to the helper and invoke privileged functionality, leading to unauthorized execution of actions with root-level privileges. | [1]https://pentraze.com/<br>[2]https://pentraze.com/vulnerability-reports/ |
| 3 | CVE-2025-32717 | 8.4  | HIGH | Heap-based buffer overflow in Microsoft Office Word allows an unauthorized attacker to execute code locally. | [1]https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-32717 |
| 4 | CVE-2025-49091 | 8.2  | HIGH | KDE Konsole before 25.04.2 allows remote code execution in a certain scenario. It supports loading URLs from the scheme handlers such as a ssh:// or telnet:// or rlogin:// URL. This can be executed regardless of whether the ssh, telnet, or rlogin binary is available. In this mode, there is a code path where if that binary is not available, Konsole falls back to using /bin/bash for the given arguments (i.e., the URL) provided. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code. | [1]https://invent.kde.org/utilities/konsole/-/commit/09d20dea109050b4c02fb73095f327b5642a2b75<br>[2]https://invent.kde.org/utilities/konsole/-/tags<br>[3]https://kde.org/info/security/advisory-20250609-1.txt<br>[4]https://konsole.kde.org/changelog.html<br>[5]https://proofnet.de/publikationen/konsole_rce.html<br>[6]https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/06/10/5 |

| 8 | CVE-2025-4799 | 7.2  | HIGH | The WP-DownloadManager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to lack of restriction on the directory a file can be deleted from in all versions up to, and including, 1.68.10. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). This vulnerability can be paired with CVE-2025-4798 to delete any file within the WordPress root directory. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-downloadmanager/trunk/download-manager.php#L215<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-downloadmanager/trunk/download-options.php#L16<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-downloadmanager/trunk/download-options.php#L42<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3294467/<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/f9d9e485-171f-4e36-943d-397d540e31f4?source=cve |
| 9 | CVE-2025-5395 | 8.8  | HIGH | The WordPress Automatic Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type validation in the `core.php` file in all versions up to, and including, 3.115.0.

| 13 | CVE-2025-4315 | 8.8  | HIGH | The CubeWP – All-in-One Dynamic Content Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.23. This is due to the plugin allowing a user to update arbitrary user meta through the update_user_meta() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to elevate their privileges to that of an administrator. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/cubewp-framework/tags/1.1.23/cube/classes/class-cubewp-rest-api.php#L691<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3306925/cubewp-framework#file2<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/430b7e72-72b8-4cf8-99f4-ee1d1d4b4f24?source=cve |

| 24 | CVE-2025-49146 | 8.2  | HIGH | pgjdbc is an open source postgresql JDBC Driver. From 42.7.4 and until 42.7.7, when the PostgreSQL JDBC driver is configured with channel binding set to required (default value is prefer), the driver would incorrectly allow connections to proceed with authentication methods that do not support channel binding (such as password, MD5, GSS, or SSPI authentication). This could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to intercept connections that users believed were protected by channel binding requirements. This vulnerability is fixed in 42.7.7. | [1]https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/9217ed16cb2918ab1b6b9258ae97e6ede244d8a0<br>[2]https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-hq9p-pm7w-8p54 |
| 25 | CVE-2025-49148 | 7.3  | HIGH | ClipShare is a lightweight and cross-platform tool for clipboard sharing. Prior to 3.8.5, ClipShare Server for Windows uses the default Windows DLL search order and loads system libraries like CRYPTBASE.dll and WindowsCodecs.dll from its own directory before the system path. A local, non-privileged user who can write to the folder containing clip_share.exe can place malicious DLLs there, leading to arbitrary code execution in the context of the server, and, if launched by an Administrator (or another elevated user), it results in a reliable local privilege escalation. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.8.5. | [1]https://github.com/thevindu-w/clip_share_server/security/advisories/GHSA-rc47-h83g-2r8j |
