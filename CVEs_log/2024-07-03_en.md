| 2 | CVE-2024-5349 | 8.8  | HIGH | The LA-Studio Element Kit for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.8.1 via the `map_style` parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3108501/lastudio-element-kit/trunk/includes/addons/google-maps.php<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/2e29a67b-2b67-4cd5-a5ae-a931900c75cd?source=cve |

| 34 | CVE-2024-36404 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | GeoTools is an open source Java library that provides tools for geospatial data. Prior to versions 31.2, 30.4, and 29.6, Remote Code Execution (RCE) is possible if an application uses certain GeoTools functionality to evaluate XPath expressions supplied by user input. Versions 31.2, 30.4, and 29.6 contain a fix for this issue. As a workaround, GeoTools can operate with reduced functionality by removing the `gt-complex` jar from one`s application. As an example of the impact, application schema `datastore` would not function without the ability to use XPath expressions to query complex content. Alternatively, one may utilize a drop-in replacement GeoTools jar from SourceForge for versions 31.1, 30.3, 30.2, 29.2, 28.2, 27.5, 27.4, 26.7, 26.4, 25.2, and 24.0. These jars are for download only and are not available from maven central, intended to quickly provide a fix to affected applications. | [1]https://github.com/Warxim/CVE-2022-41852?tab=readme-ov-file#workaround-for-cve-2022-41852<br>[2]https://github.com/geotools/geotools/commit/f0c9961dc4d40c5acfce2169fab92805738de5ea<br>[3]https://github.com/geotools/geotools/pull/4797<br>[4]https://github.com/geotools/geotools/security/advisories/GHSA-w3pj-wh35-fq8w<br>[5]https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOT-7587<br>[6]https://sourceforge.net/projects/geotools/files/GeoTools%2024%20Releases/24.0/geotools-24.0-patches.zip/download<br>[7]https://sourceforge.net/projects/geotools/files/GeoTools%2025%20Releases/25.2/geotools-25.2-patches.zip/download<br>[8]https://sourceforge.net/projects/geotools/files/GeoTools%2026%20Releases/26.4<br>[9]https://sourceforge.net/projects/geotools/files/GeoTools%2026%20Releases/26.7/geotools-26.7-patches.zip/download<br>[10]https://sourceforge.net/projects/geotools/files/GeoTools%2027%20Releases/27.4/geotools-27.4-patches.zip/download<br>[11]https://sourceforge.net/projects/geotools/files/GeoTools%2027%20Releases/27.5/geotools-27.5-patches.zip/download<br>[12]https://sourceforge.net/projects/geotools/files/GeoTools%2028%20Releases/28.2/geotools-28.2-patches.zip/download<br>[13]https://sourceforge.net/projects/geotools/files/GeoTools%2029%20Releases/29.2/geotools-29.2-patches.zip/download<br>[14]https://sourceforge.net/projects/geotools/files/GeoTools%2030%20Releases/30.2/geotools-30.2-patches.zip/download<br>[15]https://sourceforge.net/projects/geotools/files/GeoTools%2030%20Releases/30.3/geotools-30.3-patches.zip/download<br>[16]https://sourceforge.net/projects/geotools/files/GeoTools%2031%20Releases/31.1 |
| 35 | CVE-2024-38519 | 7.8  | HIGH | `yt-dlp` is a command-line audio/video downloader. Prior to version 2024.07.01, `yt-dlp` does not limit the extensions of downloaded files, which could lead to aribitrary filenames being created in the download folder (and path traversal on Windows). Since `yt-dlp` also reads config from the working directory (and on Windows executables will be executed from the yt-dlp directory) this could lead to arbitrary code being executed. `yt-dlp` version 2024.07.01 fixes this issue by whitelisting the allowed extensions. This might mean some very uncommon extensions might not get downloaded, however it will also limit the possible exploitation surface. In addition to upgrading, have `.%(ext)s` at the end of the output template and make sure the user trusts the websites that they are downloading from. Also, make sure to never download to a directory within PATH or other sensitive locations like one`s user directory, `system32`, or other binaries locations. For users who are not able to upgrade, keep the default output template (`-o "%(title)s [%(id)s].%(ext)s`); make sure the extension of the media to download is a common video/audio/sub/... one; try to avoid the generic extractor; and/or use `--ignore-config --config-location ...` to not load config from common locations. | [1]https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/5ce582448ececb8d9c30c8c31f58330090ced03a<br>[2]https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/tag/2024.07.01<br>[3]https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/security/advisories/GHSA-79w7-vh3h-8g4j<br>[4]https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-090_yt-dlp |
