|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2024-12811 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Traveler theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.8 via the `hotel_alone_slider` shortcode `style` attribute. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level and above permissions, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where php file type can be uploaded and included. | [1]https://travelerwp.com/traveler-changelog/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/a09298b3-3b5c-4a92-9332-79ff83234479?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2025-1682 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Cardealer theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions up to, and including, 1.6.4 due to missing capability check on the `save_settings` function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to modify the default user role. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/car-dealer-automotive-wordpress-theme-responsive/8574708<br>[2]https://webtemplatemasters.com/cardealer/changelog/#v165<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/4e337281-f05e-486c-9491-161365af252a?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2025-1687 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Cardealer theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.4. This is due to missing nonce validation on the `update_user_profile` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the user email and password via a forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/car-dealer-automotive-wordpress-theme-responsive/8574708<br>[2]https://webtemplatemasters.com/cardealer/changelog/#v165<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6305b7be-8651-4028-a8cf-ea58b4977225?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2025-25477 | 8.1  | HIGH | A host header injection vulnerability in SysPass 3.2x allows an attacker to load malicious JS files from an arbitrary domain which would be executed in the victim`s browser. | [1]https://github.com/sysentr0py/CVEs/tree/main/CVE-2025-25477 |
| 5 | CVE-2025-25729 | 7.5  | HIGH | An information disclosure vulnerability in Bosscomm IF740 Firmware versions:11001.7078 & v11001.0000 and System versions: 6.25 & 6.00 allows attackers to obtain hardcoded cleartext credentials via the update or boot process. | [1]https://gainsec.com/2025/02/27/cve-2025-25727cve-2025-25728cve-2025-25729-multiple-vulnerabilities-found-in-bosscomm-obd2-tablet/ |
| 6 | CVE-2025-0975 | 8.8  | HIGH | IBM MQ 9.3 LTS, 9.3 CD, 9.4 LTS, and 9.4 CD console could allow an authenticated user to execute code due to improper neutralization of escape characters. | [1]https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/7183467 |
| 7 | CVE-2025-1513 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Photos, Files, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Ecommerce Contest Gallery – Upload, Vote, Sell via PayPal or Stripe, Social Share Buttons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Name and Comment field when commenting on photo gallery entries in all versions up to, and including, 26.0.0.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3245199%40contest-gallery&new=3245199%40contest-gallery&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/1b5cf360-0163-4a7c-8979-ec89ec80ad62?source=cve |
| 8 | CVE-2024-13831 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Tabs for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0 via deserialization of untrusted input in the `product_has_custom_tabs` function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Shop Manager-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wc-tabs/trunk/wc-tabs-lite.php#L363<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/790a2c64-b358-41ed-be17-f2b99d294617?source=cve |
| 9 | CVE-2024-8420 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The DHVC Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.7. This is due to the plugin allowing a user to supply the `role` field when registering. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register as an administrator on sites. | [1]https://codecanyon.net/item/dhvc-form-wordpress-form-for-visual-composer/8326593<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e4d51a0c-c625-4732-b345-df02971fbffa?source=cve |
| 10 | CVE-2024-8425 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The WooCommerce Ultimate Gift Card plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type validation in the `mwb_wgm_preview_mail` and `mwb_wgm_woocommerce_add_cart_item_data` functions in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://codecanyon.net/item/woocommerce-ultimate-gift-card/19191057<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6ebffb82-7455-40c9-9ffd-b78e0e73e431?source=cve |
| 11 | CVE-2024-9193 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The WHMpress - WHMCS WordPress Integration Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 6.3-revision-0 via the whmpress_domain_search_ajax_extended_results() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. Utilizing the /admin/services.php file, this can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site. | [1]https://whmpress.com/docs/change-log/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/5f3b0e75-d2f0-48b7-ba33-75c4e998030e?source=cve |
| 12 | CVE-2024-9195 | 8.8  | HIGH | The WHMPress - WHMCS Client Area plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the update_settings case in the /admin/ajax.php file in all versions up to, and including, 4.3-revision-3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site. | [1]https://codecanyon.net/item/whmcs-client-area-whmpress-addon/11218646<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c8af0c5c-3d7b-416d-9d10-6867fcf909a5?source=cve |
| 13 | CVE-2025-1570 | 8.1  | HIGH | The Directorist: AI-Powered Business Directory Plugin with Classified Ads Listings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 8.1. This is due to the directorist_generate_password_reset_pin_code() and reset_user_password() functions not having enough controls to prevent a successful brute force attack of the OTP to change a password, or verify that a password reset request came from an authorized user. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to generate and brute force an OTP that makes it possible to change any users passwords, including an administrator. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3246340/directorist<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/853562ed-7f2e-453c-b3d0-67c90bd0231f?source=cve |
