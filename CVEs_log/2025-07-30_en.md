|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2025-54769 | 8.8  | HIGH | An authenticated, read-only user can upload a file and perform a directory traversal to have the uploaded file placed in a location of their choosing.  This can be used to overwrite existing PERL modules within the application to achieve remote code execution (RCE) by an attacker. | [1]https://korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2025-016.txt<br>[2]https://lpar2rrd.com/note800.php |
| 2 | CVE-2025-53078 | 8.0  | HIGH | Deserialization of Untrusted Data in Samsung DMS(Data Management Server) allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via write file to system | [1]https://security.samsungda.com/securityUpdates.html |
| 3 | CVE-2025-53080 | 7.1  | HIGH | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (`Path Traversal`) in Samsung DMS(Data Management Server) allows authenticated attackers to create arbitrary files in unintended locations on the filesystem | [1]https://security.samsungda.com/securityUpdates.html |
| 4 | CVE-2025-6495 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Bricks theme for WordPress is vulnerable to blind SQL Injection via the ‘p’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.12.4 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://bricksbuilder.io/<br>[2]https://bricksbuilder.io/release/bricks-2-0/#full-changelog<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/5ac49a00-dabc-4cd9-9032-c038ede3fd8f?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2025-7689 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Hydra Booking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to a missing capability check on the tfhb_reset_password_callback() function in versions 1.1.0 to 1.1.18.

| 6 | CVE-2025-6175 | 7.2  | HIGH | Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences (`CRLF Injection`) vulnerability in DECE Software Geodi allows HTTP Request Splitting.This issue affects Geodi: before GEODI Setup 9.0.146. | [1]https://www.usom.gov.tr/bildirim/tr-25-0182 |
| 7 | CVE-2025-6504 | 8.4  | HIGH | In HDP Server versions below 4.6.2.2978 on Linux, unauthorized access could occur via IP spoofing using the X-Forwarded-For header. Since XFF is a client-controlled header, it could be spoofed, allowing unauthorized access if the spoofed IP matched a whitelisted range.This vulnerability could be exploited to bypass IP restrictions, though valid user credentials would still be required for resource access. | [1]https://community.progress.com/s/article/DataDirect-Hybrid-Data-Pipeline-Critical-Security-Product-Alert-Bulletin-July-2025---CVE-2025-6504 |
| 8 | CVE-2025-6505 | 8.1  | HIGH | Unauthorized access and impersonation can occur in versions 4.6.2.3226 and below of Progress Software`s Hybrid Data Pipeline Server on Linux.

| 33 | CVE-2025-54381 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | BentoML is a Python library for building online serving systems optimized for AI apps and model inference. In versions 1.4.0 until 1.4.19, the file upload processing system contains an SSRF vulnerability that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to force the server to make arbitrary HTTP requests. The vulnerability stems from the multipart form data and JSON request handlers, which automatically download files from user-provided URLs without validating whether those URLs point to internal network addresses, cloud metadata endpoints, or other restricted resources. The documentation explicitly promotes this URL-based file upload feature, making it an intended design that exposes all deployed services to SSRF attacks by default. Version 1.4.19 contains a patch for the issue. | [1]https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/commit/534c3584621da4ab954bdc3d814cc66b95ae5fb8<br>[2]https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/security/advisories/GHSA-mrmq-3q62-6cc8 |
