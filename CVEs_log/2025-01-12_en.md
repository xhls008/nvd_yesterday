|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2024-12404 | 7.5  | HIGH | The CF Internal Link Shortcode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the `post_title` parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/internal-link-shortcode/trunk/internal-link-shortcode.php#L82<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/1661bb28-e5b4-4319-84bb-6cbeac266147?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2024-12627 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Coupon X: Discount Pop Up, Promo Code Pop Ups, Announcement Pop Up, WooCommerce Popups plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.5 via deserialization of untrusted input from post content passed to the capture_email AJAX action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3219466/coupon-x-discount-pop-up/trunk/inc/class-cx-rest.php<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/468be776-8804-4d2f-8eaf-841bbf598ef9?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2024-42168 | 8.9  | HIGH | HCL MyXalytics is affected by out-of-band resource load (HTTP) vulnerability.  An attacker can deploy a web server that returns malicious content, and then induce the application to retrieve and process that content. | [1]https://support.hcl-software.com/csm?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0118149 |
| 4 | CVE-2024-42169 | 7.1  | HIGH | HCL MyXalytics is affected by insecure direct object references.  It occurs due to missing access control checks, which fail to verify whether a user should be allowed to access specific data. | [1]https://support.hcl-software.com/csm?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0118149 |
| 5 | CVE-2024-12877 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The GiveWP â€“ Donation Plugin and Fundraising Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.19.2 via deserialization of untrusted input from the donation form like `firstName`. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain allows attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server that makes remote code execution possible. Please note this was only partially patched in 3.19.3, a fully sufficient patch was not released until 3.19.4. However, another CVE was assigned by another CNA for version 3.19.3 so we will leave this as affecting 3.19.2 and before. We have recommended the vendor use JSON encoding to prevent any further deserialization vulnerabilities from being present. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3212723/give/tags/3.19.3/src/Helpers/Utils.php<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b2143edf-5423-4e79-8638-a5b98490d292?source=cve |
