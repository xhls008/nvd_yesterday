| 1 | CVE-2024-5345 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Responsive Owl Carousel for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.0 via the layout parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included. The inclusion is limited to PHP files. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/responsive-owl-carousel-elementor/trunk/includes/widgets/owl-carousel.php#L669<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3092511%40responsive-owl-carousel-elementor%2Ftrunk&old=3092226%40responsive-owl-carousel-elementor%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0638c8f3-070a-4b42-ba58-396f3f259b9d?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2024-2793 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Visual Website Collaboration, Feedback & Project Management – Atarim plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via comments in all versions up to, and including, 3.30 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/atarim-visual-collaboration/trunk/inc/wpf_ajax_functions.php#L1923<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/atarim-visual-collaboration/trunk/inc/wpf_ajax_functions.php#L505<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/atarim-visual-collaboration/trunk/inc/wpf_ajax_functions.php#L666<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3094260/<br>[5]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3094999/<br>[6]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/9bd63003-d1d6-480a-8df7-878bcc89f1ee?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2024-5523 | 8.8  | HIGH | SQL injection vulnerability in Astrotalks affecting version 10/03/2023. This vulnerability could allow an authenticated local user to send a specially crafted SQL query to the `searchString` parameter and retrieve all information stored in the database. | [1]https://www.incibe.es/en/incibe-cert/notices/aviso/multiple-vulnerabilities-astrotalks |
| 4 | CVE-2024-5525 | 8.3  | HIGH | Improper privilege management vulnerability in Astrotalks affecting version 10/03/2023. This vulnerability allows a local user to access the application as an administrator without any provided credentials, allowing the attacker to perform administrative actions. | [1]https://www.incibe.es/en/incibe-cert/notices/aviso/multiple-vulnerabilities-astrotalks |
| 5 | CVE-2024-23692 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Rejetto HTTP File Server, up to and including version 2.3m, is vulnerable to a template injection vulnerability. This vulnerability allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system by sending a specially crafted HTTP request. As of the CVE assignment date, Rejetto HFS 2.3m is no longer supported. | [1]https://mohemiv.com/all/rejetto-http-file-server-2-3m-unauthenticated-rce/<br>[2]https://vulncheck.com/advisories/rejetto-unauth-rce |
| 6 | CVE-2024-36108 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | casgate is an Open Source Identity and Access Management system. In affected versions `casgate` allows remote unauthenticated attacker to obtain sensitive information via GET request to an API endpoint. This issue has been addressed in PR #201 which is pending merge. An attacker could use `id` parameter of GET requests with value `anonymous/ anonymous` to bypass authorization on certain API endpoints. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to account takeover, privilege escalation or provide attacker with credential to other services. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/casgate/casgate/pull/201<br>[2]https://github.com/casgate/casgate/security/advisories/GHSA-mj5q-rc67-h56c |
| 7 | CVE-2024-5565 | 8.1  | HIGH | The Vanna library uses a prompt function to present the user with visualized results, it is possible to alter the prompt using prompt injection and run arbitrary Python code instead of the intended visualization code. Specifically - allowing external input to the library’s “ask” method with "visualize" set to True (default behavior) leads to remote code execution. | [1]https://research.jfrog.com/vulnerabilities/vanna-prompt-injection-rce-jfsa-2024-001034449/ |
| 8 | CVE-2024-35140 | 7.7  | HIGH | IBM Security Verify Access Docker 10.0.0 through 10.0.6 could allow a local user to escalate their privileges due to improper certificate validation.
