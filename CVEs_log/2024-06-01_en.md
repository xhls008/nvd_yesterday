| 1 | CVE-2024-36108 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | casgate is an Open Source Identity and Access Management system. In affected versions `casgate` allows remote unauthenticated attacker to obtain sensitive information via GET request to an API endpoint. This issue has been addressed in PR #201 which is pending merge. An attacker could use `id` parameter of GET requests with value `anonymous/ anonymous` to bypass authorization on certain API endpoints. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to account takeover, privilege escalation or provide attacker with credential to other services. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/casgate/casgate/pull/201<br>[2]https://github.com/casgate/casgate/security/advisories/GHSA-mj5q-rc67-h56c |
| 2 | CVE-2024-5565 | 8.1  | HIGH | The Vanna library uses a prompt function to present the user with visualized results, it is possible to alter the prompt using prompt injection and run arbitrary Python code instead of the intended visualization code. Specifically - allowing external input to the library’s “ask” method with "visualize" set to True (default behavior) leads to remote code execution. | [1]https://research.jfrog.com/vulnerabilities/vanna-prompt-injection-rce-jfsa-2024-001034449/ |

| 7 | CVE-2024-3564 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Content Blocks (Custom Post Widget) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.0 via the plugin`s `content_block` shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3078739%40custom-post-widget&new=3078739%40custom-post-widget&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c5a0b8fe-d284-4780-84b5-2e97fa96c99a?source=cve |
| 8 | CVE-2024-4958 | 7.1  | HIGH | The User Registration – Custom Registration Form, Login Form, and User Profile WordPress Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the `import_form_action` function in versions up to, and including, 3.2.0.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to import a registration form with a default user role of administrator. If an administrator approves or publishes a post or page with the shortcode to the imported form, any user can register as an administrator. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3095484/user-registration/tags/3.2.1/includes/class-ur-ajax.php<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/710574a8-a6e2-4ee6-9ea7-03a34994fec7?source=cve |
