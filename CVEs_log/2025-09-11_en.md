| 1 | CVE-2025-10001 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Import any XML, CSV or Excel File to WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the import functionality in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload unsafe files like .phar files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3358208/wp-all-import/trunk/classes/upload.php<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/bb03aeb8-32ab-4962-bc95-b10fb7bd7fcf?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2025-10040 | 7.7  | HIGH | The WP Import – Ultimate CSV XML Importer for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the `get_ftp_details` AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 7.27. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to retrieve a configured set of SFTP/FTP credentials. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-ultimate-csv-importer/tags/7.26/uploadModules/FtpUpload.php#L231<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3357936/wp-ultimate-csv-importer/trunk/uploadModules/FtpUpload.php<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/9bcdcaa4-c492-4d79-8d18-44802abd02e7?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2025-10049 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Responsive Filterable Portfolio plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via the HdnMediaSelection_image field in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.24. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?old_path=/responsive-filterable-portfolio/tags/1.0.24&new_path=/responsive-filterable-portfolio/tags/1.0.25&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/017f5894-be0d-4b0f-82bd-13bf7e2ff53f?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2025-41714 | 8.8  | HIGH | The upload endpoint insufficiently validates the `Upload-Key` request header.

| 6 | CVE-2025-9943 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | An SQL injection vulnerability has been identified in the "ID" attribute of the SAML response when the replay cache of the Shibboleth Service Provider (SP) is configured to use an SQL database as storage service. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this issue via blind SQL injection, allowing for the extraction of arbitrary data from the database, if the database connection is configured to use the ODBC plugin. The vulnerability arises from insufficient escaping of single quotes in the class SQLString (file odbc-store.cpp, lines 253-271).This issue affects Shibboleth Service Provider through 3.5.0. | [1]https://r.sec-consult.com/shibboleth<br>[2]https://shibboleth.net/community/advisories/secadv_20250903.txt<br>[3]https://shibboleth.net/downloads/service-provider/3.5.1/ |

| 28 | CVE-2025-54123 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Hoverfly is an open source API simulation tool. In versions 1.11.3 and prior, the middleware functionality in Hoverfly is vulnerable to command injection vulnerability at `/api/v2/hoverfly/middleware` endpoint due to insufficient validation and sanitization in user input. The vulnerability exists in the middleware management API endpoint `/api/v2/hoverfly/middleware`. This issue is born due to combination of three code level flaws: Insufficient Input Validation in middleware.go line 94-96; Unsafe Command Execution in local_middleware.go line 14-19; and Immediate Execution During Testing in hoverfly_service.go line 173. This allows an attacker to gain remote code execution (RCE) on any system running the vulnerable Hoverfly service. Since the input is directly passed to system commands without proper checks, an attacker can upload a malicious payload or directly execute arbitrary commands (including reverse shells) on the host server with the privileges of the Hoverfly process. Commit 17e60a9bc78826deb4b782dca1c1abd3dbe60d40 in version 1.12.0 disables the set middleware API by default, and subsequent changes to documentation make users aware of the security changes of exposing the set middleware API. | [1]https://github.com/SpectoLabs/hoverfly/blob/master/core/hoverfly_service.go#L173<br>[2]https://github.com/SpectoLabs/hoverfly/blob/master/core/middleware/local_middleware.go#L13<br>[3]https://github.com/SpectoLabs/hoverfly/blob/master/core/middleware/middleware.go#L93<br>[4]https://github.com/SpectoLabs/hoverfly/commit/17e60a9bc78826deb4b782dca1c1abd3dbe60d40<br>[5]https://github.com/SpectoLabs/hoverfly/commit/a9d4da7bd7269651f54542ab790d0c613d568d3e<br>[6]https://github.com/SpectoLabs/hoverfly/security/advisories/GHSA-r4h8-hfp2-ggmf<br>[7]https://github.com/SpectoLabs/hoverfly/security/advisories/GHSA-r4h8-hfp2-ggmf |

Prior to version 9.2.0, a mock API configuration for static file serving follows the same approach presented in the documentation page, where the server filename is generated via templating features from user input is vulnerable to Path Traversal and LFI, allowing an attacker to get any file in the mock server filesystem.The issue may be particularly relevant in cloud hosted server instances. Version 9.2.0 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/blob/1ed31c4059d7f757f6cb2a43e10dc81b0d9c55a9/packages/commons-server/src/libs/server/server.ts#L1400<br>[2]https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/blob/1ed31c4059d7f757f6cb2a43e10dc81b0d9c55a9/packages/commons-server/src/libs/server/server.ts#L1551<br>[3]https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/commit/c7f6e23e87dc3b8cc44e5802af046200a797bd2e<br>[4]https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/security/advisories/GHSA-w7f9-wqc4-3wxr |
