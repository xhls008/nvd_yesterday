| 1 | CVE-2025-5396 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Bears Backup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.0. This is due to the bbackup_ajax_handle() function not having a capability check, nor validating user supplied input passed directly to call_user_func(). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute code on the server which can be leverage to inject backdoors or create new administrative user accounts to name a few things. On WordPress sites running the Alone theme versions 7.8.4 and older, this can be chained with CVE-2025-5394 to install the Bears Backup plugin and achieve the same impact. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/alone-charity-multipurpose-nonprofit-wordpress-theme/15019939<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/81b44abb-6d30-4930-b68b-9a04d93f5169?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2025-7712 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | The Madara - Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the wp_manga_delete_zip() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.3.
