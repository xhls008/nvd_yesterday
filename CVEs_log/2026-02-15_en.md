| 1 | CVE-2026-0692 | 7.5  | HIGH | The BlueSnap Payment Gateway for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.0. This is due to the plugin relying on WooCommerce`s `WC_Geolocation::get_ip_address()` function to validate IPN requests, which trusts user-controllable headers like X-Real-IP and X-Forwarded-For to determine the client IP address. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass IP allowlist restrictions by spoofing a whitelisted BlueSnap IP address and send forged IPN (Instant Payment Notification) data to manipulate order statuses (mark orders as paid, failed, refunded, or on-hold) without proper authorization. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/bluesnap-payment-gateway-for-woocommerce/tags/3.4.0/includes/class-wc-bluesnap-ipn-webhooks.php#L417<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/bluesnap-payment-gateway-for-woocommerce/trunk/includes/class-wc-bluesnap-ipn-webhooks.php#L417<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/dc676e18-c895-4f6a-bce9-1f92207af885?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2026-2144 | 8.1  | HIGH | The Magic Login Mail or QR Code plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 2.05. This is due to the plugin storing the magic login QR code image with a predictable, static filename (QR_Code.png) in the publicly accessible WordPress uploads directory during the email sending process. The file is only deleted after wp_mail() completes, creating an exploitable race condition window. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger a login link request for any user, including administrators, and then exploit the race condition between QR code file creation and deletion to obtain the login URL encoded in the QR code, thereby gaining unauthorized access to the targeted user`s account. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/magic-login-mail/trunk/lib/class-magicloginmail.php#L250<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/magic-login-mail/trunk/lib/class-magicloginmail.php#L325<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/65066a17-653b-4444-9bd0-894ea8c1acb1?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2026-2469 | 7.6  | HIGH | Versions of the package directorytree/imapengine before 1.22.3 are vulnerable to Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component (`Injection`) via the id() function in ImapConnection.php due to improperly escaping user input before including it in IMAP ID commands. This allows attackers to read or delete victim`s emails, terminate the victim`s session or execute any valid IMAP command on victim`s mailbox by including quote characters " or CRLF sequences \r\n in the input. | [1]https://gist.github.com/wanamirulhakim/74b41589cdea3c07c3375e5946960778<br>[2]https://github.com/DirectoryTree/ImapEngine/commit/87fca56affd9527e6907a705e6d600c5174d9a5a<br>[3]https://github.com/DirectoryTree/ImapEngine/pull/150<br>[4]https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PHP-DIRECTORYTREEIMAPENGINE-15274300 |
| 4 | CVE-2026-0745 | 7.2  | HIGH | The User Language Switch plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.10 due to missing URL validation on the `download_language()` function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and modify information from internal services. | [1]https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/user-language-switch.zip<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/user-language-switch/tags/1.6.10/uls-options.php#L451<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/user-language-switch/trunk/uls-options.php#L451<br>[4]https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-language-switch/<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/4d8d15be-6a7b-485e-a338-ccf1a6eb226c?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2026-0753 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Super Simple Contact Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the `sscf_name` parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. | [1]https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/super-simple-contact-form.1.6.2.zip<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/super-simple-contact-form/tags/1.6.2/super-simple-contact-form.php#L152<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/super-simple-contact-form/trunk/super-simple-contact-form.php#L152<br>[4]https://wordpress.org/plugins/super-simple-contact-form/<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e10c0d8d-718d-45dd-9ac3-a2673a6a16af?source=cve |
| 6 | CVE-2026-1306 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The midi-Synth plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type and file extension validation in the `export` AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible granted the attacker can obtain a valid nonce. The nonce is exposed in frontend JavaScript making it trivially accessible to unauthenticated attackers. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/midi-synth/tags/1.1.0/midiSynth.php#L110<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/midi-synth/tags/1.1.0/midiSynth.php#L121<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/midi-synth/tags/1.1.0/midiSynthConvert.php#L421<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/midi-synth/tags/1.1.0/midiSynthConvert.php#L492<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d5b695d7-c690-4748-b218-5699d1aa63bf?source=cve |
| 7 | CVE-2026-1988 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Flexi Product Slider and Grid for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.5 via the `flexipsg_carousel` shortcode. This is due to the `theme` parameter being directly concatenated into a file path without proper sanitization or validation, allowing directory traversal. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary PHP files on the server via the `theme` parameter granted they can create posts with shortcodes. | [1]https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html<br>[2]https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/98.html<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/flexi-product-slider-grid/tags/1.0.5/includes/class-flexipsg-shortcode.php#L82<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/flexi-product-slider-grid/trunk/includes/class-flexipsg-shortcode.php#L82<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/ffdd5446-5835-4976-b764-9b5c75251438?source=cve |
| 8 | CVE-2026-2024 | 7.5  | HIGH | The PhotoStack Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the `postid` parameter in all versions up to, and including, 0.4.1 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/photostack-gallery/trunk/photo_gallery.php#L108<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/photostack-gallery/trunk/photo_gallery.php#L113<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/photostack-gallery/trunk/photo_gallery.php#L142<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/9232b77e-e23f-4e91-8ea3-5e740956f51e?source=cve |
| 9 | CVE-2025-8572 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Truelysell Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions less than, or equal to, 1.8.7. This is due to insufficient validation of the user_role parameter during user registration. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create accounts with elevated privileges, including administrator access. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/truelysell-service-booking-wordpress-theme/43398124<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b027c9f9-3144-4783-b646-ee1e02cd27ef?source=cve |
| 10 | CVE-2026-1843 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Super Page Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Activity Log in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
