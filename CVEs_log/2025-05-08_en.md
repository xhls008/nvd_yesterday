| 1 | CVE-2025-3844 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The PeproDev Ultimate Profile Solutions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in versions 1.9.1 to 7.5.2. This is due to handel_ajax_req() function not having proper restrictions on the change_user_meta functionality that makes it possible to set a OTP code and subsequently log in with that OTP code. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to login as other users on the site, including administrators. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/peprodev-ups/tags/7.5.2/login/login.php#L1483<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/peprodev-ups/tags/7.5.2/login/login.php#L2836<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/65be9417-7029-4f34-b834-98208a42743b?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2025-3852 | 8.8  | HIGH | The WPshop 2 – E-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in versions 2.0.0 to 2.6.0.

| 54 | CVE-2025-46827 | 8.0  | HIGH | Graylog is a free and open log management platform. Prior to versions 6.0.14, 6.1.10, and 6.2.0, it is possible to obtain user session cookies by submitting an HTML form as part of an Event Definition Remediation Step field. For this attack to succeed, the attacker needs a user account with permissions to create event definitions, while the user must have permissions to view alerts. Additionally, an active Input must be present on the Graylog server that is capable of receiving form data (e.g. a HTTP input, TCP raw or syslog etc). Versions 6.0.14, 6.1.10, and 6.2.0 fix the issue. No known workarounds are available, as long as the relatively rare prerequisites are met. | [1]https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/security/advisories/GHSA-76vf-mpmx-777j |

| 72 | CVE-2025-46727 | 7.5  | HIGH | Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Prior to versions 2.2.14, 3.0.16, and 3.1.14, `Rack::QueryParser` parses query strings and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies into Ruby data structures without imposing any limit on the number of parameters, allowing attackers to send requests with extremely large numbers of parameters. The vulnerability arises because `Rack::QueryParser` iterates over each `&`-separated key-value pair and adds it to a Hash without enforcing an upper bound on the total number of parameters. This allows an attacker to send a single request containing hundreds of thousands (or more) of parameters, which consumes excessive memory and CPU during parsing. An attacker can trigger denial of service by sending specifically crafted HTTP requests, which can cause memory exhaustion or pin CPU resources, stalling or crashing the Rack server. This results in full service disruption until the affected worker is restarted. Versions 2.2.14, 3.0.16, and 3.1.14 fix the issue. Some other mitigations are available. One may use middleware to enforce a maximum query string size or parameter count, or employ a reverse proxy (such as Nginx) to limit request sizes and reject oversized query strings or bodies. Limiting request body sizes and query string lengths at the web server or CDN level is an effective mitigation. | [1]https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/2bb5263b464b65ba4b648996a579dbd180d2b712<br>[2]https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/3f5a4249118d09d199fe480466c8c6717e43b6e3<br>[3]https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/cd6b70a1f2a1016b73dc906f924869f4902c2d74<br>[4]https://github.com/rack/rack/security/advisories/GHSA-gjh7-p2fx-99vx |
