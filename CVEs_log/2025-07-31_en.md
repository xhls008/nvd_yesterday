| 32 | CVE-2025-54430 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | dedupe is a python library that uses machine learning to perform fuzzy matching, deduplication and entity resolution quickly on structured data. Before commit 3f61e79, a critical severity vulnerability has been identified within the .github/workflows/benchmark-bot.yml workflow, where a issue_comment can be triggered using the @benchmark body. This workflow is susceptible to exploitation as it checkout the ${{ github.event.issue.number }}, which correspond to the branch of the PR manipulated by potentially malicious actors, and where untrusted code may be executed. Running untrusted code may lead to the exfiltration of GITHUB_TOKEN, which in this workflow has write permissions on most of the scopes - in particular the contents one - and could lead to potential repository takeover. This is fixed by commit 3f61e79. | [1]https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe/commit/3f61e79102910bd355e920a2df7e44c14c9cb247<br>[2]https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe/security/advisories/GHSA-wrg3-xqw8-m85p |

| 48 | CVE-2025-53022 | 8.6  | HIGH | TrustedFirmware-M (aka Trusted Firmware for M profile Arm CPUs) before 2.1.3 and 2.2.x before 2.2.1 lacks length validation during a firmware upgrade. While processing a new image, the Firmware Upgrade (FWU) module does not validate the length field of the Type-Length-Value (TLV) structure for dependent components against the maximum allowed size. If the length specified in the TLV exceeds the size of the buffer allocated on the stack, the FWU module will overwrite the buffer (and potentially other stack data) with the TLV`s value content. An attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious TLV entry in the unprotected section of the MCUBoot upgrade image. By setting the length field to exceed the expected structure size, the attacker can manipulate the stack memory of the system during the upgrade process. | [1]https://git.trustedfirmware.org/plugins/gitiles/TF-M/trusted-firmware-m.git/+/refs/heads/main/secure_fw/partitions/firmware_update/bootloader/mcuboot/tfm_mcuboot_fwu.c#257<br>[2]https://trustedfirmware-m.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security/security_advisories/fwu_tlv_payload_out_of_bounds_vulnerability.html<br>[3]https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/tf-m/ |
| 49 | CVE-2025-54576 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | OAuth2-Proxy is an open-source tool that can act as either a standalone reverse proxy or a middleware component integrated into existing reverse proxy or load balancer setups. In versions 7.10.0 and below, oauth2-proxy deployments are vulnerable when using the skip_auth_routes configuration option with regex patterns. Attackers can bypass authentication by crafting URLs with query parameters that satisfy configured regex patterns, allowing unauthorized access to protected resources. The issue stems from skip_auth_routes matching against the full request URI. Deployments using skip_auth_routes with regex patterns containing wildcards or broad matching patterns are most at risk. This issue is fixed in version 7.11.0. Workarounds include: auditing all skip_auth_routes configurations for overly permissive patterns, replacing wildcard patterns with exact path matches where possible, ensuring regex patterns are properly anchored (starting with ^ and ending with $), or implementing custom validation that strips query parameters before regex matching. | [1]https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/blob/f4b33b64bd66ad28e9b0d63bea51837b83c00ca1/oauthproxy.go#L582-L584<br>[2]https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/blob/f4b33b64bd66ad28e9b0d63bea51837b83c00ca1/pkg/requests/util/util.go#L37-L44<br>[3]https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/commit/9ffafad4b2d2f9f7668e5504565f356a7c047b77<br>[4]https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/releases/tag/v7.11.0<br>[5]https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-7rh7-c77v-6434<br>[6]https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/configuration/overview/#proxy-options |
| 50 | CVE-2025-54581 | 7.5  | HIGH | vproxy is an HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS5 proxy server. In versions 2.3.3 and below, untrusted data is extracted from the user-controlled HTTP Proxy-Authorization header and passed to Extension::try_from and flows into parse_ttl_extension where it is parsed as a TTL value. If an attacker supplies a TTL of zero (e.g. by using a username such as `configuredUser-ttl-0`), the modulo operation `timestamp % ttl` will cause a division by zero panic, causing the server to crash causing a denial-of-service. This is fixed in version 2.4.0. | [1]https://github.com/0x676e67/vproxy/commit/aa1bf64c5e7f1c471395f9f29175ffc1b16a1079<br>[2]https://github.com/0x676e67/vproxy/releases/tag/v2.4.0<br>[3]https://github.com/0x676e67/vproxy/security/advisories/GHSA-7h24-c332-p48c |

| 55 | CVE-2025-54586 | 7.1  | HIGH | GitProxy is an application that stands between developers and a Git remote endpoint. In versions 1.19.1 and below,   attackers can inject extra commits into the pack sent to GitHub, commits that aren’t pointed to by any branch. Although these “hidden” commits never show up in the repository’s visible history, GitHub still serves them at their direct commit URLs. This lets an attacker exfiltrate sensitive data without ever leaving a trace in the branch view. We rate this a High‑impact vulnerability because it completely compromises repository confidentiality. This is fixed in version 1.19.2. | [1]https://github.com/finos/git-proxy/commit/9c1449f4ec37d2d1f3edf4328bc3757e8dba2110<br>[2]https://github.com/finos/git-proxy/commit/a620a2f33c39c78e01783a274580bf822af3cc3a<br>[3]https://github.com/finos/git-proxy/releases/tag/v1.19.2<br>[4]https://github.com/finos/git-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-v98g-8rqx-g93g |
