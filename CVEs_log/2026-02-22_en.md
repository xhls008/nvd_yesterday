| 1 | CVE-2026-27134 | 8.1  | HIGH | Strimzi provides a way to run an Apache Kafka cluster on Kubernetes or OpenShift in various deployment configurations. In versions  0.49.0 through 0.50.0, when using a custom Cluster or Clients CA with a multistage CA chain consisting of multiple CAs, Strimzi incorrectly configures the trusted certificates for mTLS authentication on the internal as well as user-configured listeners. All CAs from the CA chain will be trusted. And users with certificates signed by any of the CAs in the chain will be able to authenticate. This issue affects only users using a custom Cluster or Clients CA with a multistage CA chain consisting of multiple CAs. It does not affect users using the Strimzi-managed Cluster and Clients CAs. It also does not affect users using custom Cluster or Clients CA with only a single CA (i.e., no CA chain with multiple CAs). This issue has been fixed in version 0.50.1. To workaround this issue, instead of providing the full CA chain as the custom CA, users can provide only the single CA that should be used. | [1]https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/releases/tag/0.50.1<br>[2]https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/security/advisories/GHSA-2qwx-rq6j-8r6j |
| 2 | CVE-2026-27168 | 8.8  | HIGH | SAIL is a cross-platform library for loading and saving images with support for animation, metadata, and ICC profiles. All versions are vulnerable to Heap-based Buffer Overflow through the XWD parser`s use of the bytes_per_line value. The value os read directly from the file as the read size in io->strict_read(), and is never compared to the actual size of the destination buffer. An attacker can provide an XWD file with an arbitrarily large bytes_per_line, causing a massive write operation beyond the buffer heap allocated for the image pixels. The issue did not have a fix at the time of publication. | [1]https://github.com/HappySeaFox/sail/security/advisories/GHSA-3g38-x2pj-mv55 |
| 3 | CVE-2026-27169 | 8.9  | HIGH | OpenSift is an AI study tool that sifts through large datasets using semantic search and generative AI. Versions 1.1.2-alpha and below render untrusted user/model content in chat tool UI surfaces using unsafe HTML interpolation patterns, leading to XSS. Stored content can execute JavaScript when later viewed in authenticated sessions. An attacker who can influence stored study/quiz/flashcard content could trigger script execution in a victim’s browser, potentially performing actions as that user in the local app session. This issue has been fixed in version 1.1.3-alpha. | [1]https://github.com/OpenSift/OpenSift/releases/tag/v1.1.3-alpha<br>[2]https://github.com/OpenSift/OpenSift/security/advisories/GHSA-qrpx-7cmv-5gv5 |
| 4 | CVE-2026-27170 | 7.1  | HIGH | OpenSift is an AI study tool that sifts through large datasets using semantic search and generative AI. In versions 1.1.2-alpha and below, URL ingest allows overly permissive server-side fetch behavior and can be coerced into requesting unsafe targets. Potential access/probing of private/local network resources from the OpenSift host process when ingesting attacker-controlled URLs. This issue has been fixed in version 1.1.3-alpha. To workaround when using trusted local-only exceptions, use OPENSIFT_ALLOW_PRIVATE_URLS=true with caution. | [1]https://github.com/OpenSift/OpenSift/releases/tag/v1.1.3-alpha<br>[2]https://github.com/OpenSift/OpenSift/security/advisories/GHSA-3w2r-hj5p-h6pp |
| 5 | CVE-2026-27203 | 8.3  | HIGH | eBay API MCP Server is an open source local MCP server providing AI assistants with comprehensive access to eBay`s Sell APIs. All versions are vulnerable to Environment Variable Injection through the updateEnvFile function. The ebay_set_user_tokens tool allows updating the .env file with new tokens. The updateEnvFile function in src/auth/oauth.ts blindly appends or replaces values without validating them for newlines or quotes. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary environment variables into the configuration file. An attacker can inject arbitrary environment variables into the .env file. This could lead to configuration overwrites, Denial of Service, and potential RCE. There was no fix for this issue at the time of publication. | [1]https://github.com/YosefHayim/ebay-mcp/commit/aab0bda75ea9dd27aa37d0d8524d7cf41b3c4a9a<br>[2]https://github.com/YosefHayim/ebay-mcp/security/advisories/GHSA-97rm-xj73-33jh |
| 6 | CVE-2026-27196 | 8.1  | HIGH | Statmatic is a Laravel and Git powered content management system (CMS). Versions 5.73.8 and below in addition to 6.0.0-alpha.1 through 6.3.1 have a Stored XSS vulnerability in html fieldtypes which allows authenticated users with field management permissions to inject malicious JavaScript that executes when viewed by higher-privileged users. This issue has been fixed in 6.3.2 and 5.73.9. | [1]https://github.com/statamic/cms/commit/11ae40e62edd3da044d37ebf264757a09cc2347b<br>[2]https://github.com/statamic/cms/commit/6c270dacc2be02bfc2eee500766f3309f59d47b3<br>[3]https://github.com/statamic/cms/security/advisories/GHSA-8r7r-f4gm-wcpq |
| 7 | CVE-2026-27197 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | Sentry is a developer-first error tracking and performance monitoring tool. Versions 21.12.0 through 26.1.0 have a critical vulnerability in its SAML SSO implementation  which allows an attacker to take over any user account by using a malicious SAML Identity Provider and another organization on the same Sentry instance. Self-hosted users are only at risk if the following criteria is met: ore than one organizations are configured (SENTRY_SINGLE_ORGANIZATION = True), or malicious user has existing access and permissions to modify SSO settings for another organization in a multo-organization instance. This issue has been fixed in version 26.2.0. To workaround this issue, implement user account-based two-factor authentication to prevent an attacker from being able to complete authentication with a victim`s user account. Organization administrators cannot do this on a user`s behalf, this requires individual users to ensure 2FA has been enabled for their account. | [1]https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/security/advisories/GHSA-ggmg-cqg6-j45g |
| 8 | CVE-2026-26045 | 7.2  | HIGH | A flaw was identified in Moodle’s backup restore functionality where specially crafted backup files were not properly validated during processing. If a malicious backup file is restored, it could lead to unintended execution of server-side code. Since restore capabilities are typically available to privileged users, exploitation requires authenticated access. Successful exploitation could result in full compromise of the Moodle server. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2026-26045<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2440901 |
| 9 | CVE-2026-26046 | 7.2  | HIGH | A vulnerability was found in a Moodle TeX filter administrative setting where insufficient sanitization of configuration input could allow command injection. On sites where the TeX filter is enabled and ImageMagick is installed, a maliciously crafted setting value entered by an administrator could result in unintended system command execution. While exploitation requires administrative privileges, successful compromise could affect the entire Moodle server. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2026-26046<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2440903 |
| 10 | CVE-2026-27198 | 8.8  | HIGH | Formwork is a flat file-based Content Management System (CMS). In versions 2.0.0 through 2.3.3, the application fails to properly enforce role-based authorization during account creation. Although the system validates that the specified role exists, it does not verify whether the current user has sufficient privileges to assign highly privileged roles such as admin. As a result, an authenticated user with the editor role can create a new account with administrative privileges, leading to full administrative access and complete compromise of the CMS. This issue has been fixed in version 2.3.4. | [1]https://github.com/getformwork/formwork/commit/19390a0b408e084bdef86f3581e050f3ee51e7cd<br>[2]https://github.com/getformwork/formwork/releases/tag/2.3.4<br>[3]https://github.com/getformwork/formwork/security/advisories/GHSA-34p4-7w83-35g2 |
| 11 | CVE-2026-27206 | 8.1  | HIGH | Zumba Json Serializer is a library to serialize PHP variables in JSON format. In versions 3.2.2 and below, the library allows deserialization of PHP objects from JSON using a special @type field. The deserializer instantiates any class specified in the @type field without restriction. When processing untrusted JSON input, this behavior may allow an attacker to instantiate arbitrary classes available in the application. If a vulnerable application passes attacker-controlled JSON into JsonSerializer::unserialize() and contains classes with dangerous magic methods (such as __wakeup() or __destruct()), this may lead to PHP Object Injection and potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE), depending on available gadget chains in the application or its dependencies. This behavior is similar in risk profile to PHP`s native unserialize() when used without the allowed_classes restriction. Applications are impacted only if untrusted or attacker-controlled JSON is passed into JsonSerializer::unserialize() and the application or its dependencies contain classes that can be leveraged as a gadget chain. This issue has been fixed in version 3.2.3. If an immediate upgrade isn`t feasible, mitigate the vulnerability by never deserializing untrusted JSON with JsonSerializer::unserialize(), validating and sanitizing all JSON input before deserialization, and disabling @type-based object instantiation wherever possible. | [1]https://github.com/zumba/json-serializer/commit/bf26227879adefce75eb9651040d8982be97b881<br>[2]https://github.com/zumba/json-serializer/releases/tag/3.2.3<br>[3]https://github.com/zumba/json-serializer/security/advisories/GHSA-v7m3-fpcr-h7m2 |
| 12 | CVE-2026-27464 | 7.7  | HIGH | Metabase is an open-source data analytics platform. In versions prior to 0.57.13 and versions 0.58.x through 0.58.6, authenticated users are able to retrieve sensitive information from a Metabase instance, including database access credentials. During testing, it was confirmed that a low-privileged user can extract sensitive information including database credentials, into the email body via template evaluation. This issue has been fixed in versions 0.57.13 and 0.58.7. To workaround this issue, users can disable notifications in their Metabase instance to disallow access to the vulnerable endpoints. | [1]https://github.com/metabase/metabase/releases/tag/v0.57.13<br>[2]https://github.com/metabase/metabase/releases/tag/v0.58.7<br>[3]https://github.com/metabase/metabase/security/advisories/GHSA-vcj8-rcm8-gfj9 |
| 13 | CVE-2026-27466 | 7.2  | HIGH | BigBlueButton is an open-source virtual classroom. In versions 3.0.21 and below, the official documentation for "Server Customization" on Support for ClamAV as presentation file scanner contains instructions that leave a BBB server vulnerable for Denial of Service. The flawed command exposes both ports (3310 and 7357) to the internet. A remote attacker can use this to send complex or large documents to clamd and waste server resources, or shutdown the clamd process. The clamd documentation explicitly warns about exposing this port. Enabling ufw (ubuntu firewall) during install does not help, because Docker routes container traffic through the nat table, which is not managed or restricted by ufw. Rules installed by ufw in the filter table have no effect on docker traffic. In addition, the provided example also mounts /var/bigbluebutton with write permissions into the container, which should not be required. Future vulnerabilities in clamd may allow attackers to manipulate files in that folder. Users are unaffected unless they have opted in to follow the extra instructions from BigBlueButton`s documentation. This issue has been fixed in version 3.0.22. | [1]https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/commit/f3d33d94a9682e87c7d41f55700b19d61e1ab8b4<br>[2]https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/security/advisories/GHSA-wmhx-qw2p-w6gc |
| 14 | CVE-2026-27470 | 8.8  | HIGH | ZoneMinder is a free, open source closed-circuit television software application. In versions 1.36.37 and below and 1.37.61 through 1.38.0, there is a second-order SQL Injection vulnerability in the web/ajax/status.php file within the getNearEvents() function. Event field values (specifically Name and Cause) are stored safely via parameterized queries but are later retrieved and concatenated directly into SQL WHERE clauses without escaping. An authenticated user with Events edit and view permissions can exploit this to execute arbitrary SQL queries. | [1]https://github.com/ZoneMinder/zoneminder/releases/tag/1.36.38<br>[2]https://github.com/ZoneMinder/zoneminder/releases/tag/1.38.1<br>[3]https://github.com/ZoneMinder/zoneminder/security/advisories/GHSA-r6gm-478g-f2c4<br>[4]https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection |

| 16 | CVE-2026-27479 | 7.7  | HIGH | Wallos is an open-source, self-hostable personal subscription tracker. Versions 4.6.0 and below contain a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the subscription and payment logo/icon upload functionality. The application validates the IP address of the provided URL before making the request, but allows HTTP redirects (CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION = true), enabling an attacker to bypass the IP validation and access internal resources, including cloud instance metadata endpoints. The getLogoFromUrl() function validates the URL by resolving the hostname and checking if the resulting IP is in a private or reserved range using FILTER_FLAG_NO_PRIV_RANGE | FILTER_FLAG_NO_RES_RANGE. However, the subsequent cURL request is configured with CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION = true and CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS = 3, which means the request will follow HTTP redirects without re-validating the destination IP. This issue has been fixed in version 4.6.1. | [1]https://github.com/ellite/Wallos/commit/76a53df9cb4658123b8f0b7cf1826f1ba7d1c960<br>[2]https://github.com/ellite/Wallos/releases/tag/v4.6.1<br>[3]https://github.com/ellite/Wallos/security/advisories/GHSA-fgmf-7g5v-jmjg |

| 18 | CVE-2026-27574 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | OneUptime is a solution for monitoring and managing online services. In versions 9.5.13 and below, custom JavaScript monitor feature uses Node.js`s node:vm module (explicitly documented as not a security mechanism) to execute user-supplied code, allowing trivial sandbox escape via a well-known one-liner that grants full access to the underlying process. Because the probe runs with host networking and holds all cluster credentials (ONEUPTIME_SECRET, DATABASE_PASSWORD, REDIS_PASSWORD, CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD) in its environment variables, and monitor creation is available to the lowest role (ProjectMember) with open registration enabled by default, any anonymous user can achieve full cluster compromise in about 30 seconds. This issue has been fixed in version 10.0.5. | [1]https://github.com/OneUptime/oneuptime/commit/7f9ed4d43945574702a26b7c206e38cc344fe427<br>[2]https://github.com/OneUptime/oneuptime/security/advisories/GHSA-v264-xqh4-9xmm |
