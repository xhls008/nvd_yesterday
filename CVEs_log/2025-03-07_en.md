| 8 | CVE-2024-58060 | 7.8  | HIGH | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: Reject struct_ops registration that uses module ptr and the module btf_id is missingThere is a UAF report in the bpf_struct_ops when CONFIG_MODULES=n.In particular, the report is on tcp_congestion_ops that hasa "struct module *owner" member.For struct_ops that has a "struct module *owner" member,it can be extended either by the regular kernel module orby the bpf_struct_ops. bpf_try_module_get() will be usedto do the refcounting and different refcount is donebased on the owner pointer. When CONFIG_MODULES=n,the btf_id of the "struct module" is missing:WARN: resolve_btfids: unresolved symbol moduleThus, the bpf_try_module_get() cannot do the correct refcounting.Not all subsystem`s struct_ops requires the "struct module *owner" member.e.g. the recent sched_ext_ops.This patch is to disable bpf_struct_ops registration ifthe struct_ops has the "struct module *" member and the"struct module" btf_id is missing. The btf_type_is_fwd() helperis moved to the btf.h header file for this test.This has happened since the beginning of bpf_struct_ops which has gonethrough many changes. The Fixes tag is set to a recent commit that thispatch can apply cleanly. Considering CONFIG_MODULES=n is notcommon and the age of the issue, targeting for bpf-next also. | [1]https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2324fb4e92092837ee278fdd8d60c48ee1a619ce<br>[2]https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/96ea081ed52bf077cad6d00153b6fba68e510767<br>[3]https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b777b14c2a4a4e2322daf8e8ffd42d2b88831b17 |
