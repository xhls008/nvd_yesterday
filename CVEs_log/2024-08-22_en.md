| 12 | CVE-2024-28000 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Incorrect Privilege Assignment vulnerability in LiteSpeed Technologies LiteSpeed Cache litespeed-cache allows Privilege Escalation.This issue affects LiteSpeed Cache: from 1.9 through 6.3.0.1. | [1]https://patchstack.com/articles/critical-privilege-escalation-in-litespeed-cache-plugin-affecting-5-million-sites?_s_id=cve<br>[2]https://patchstack.com/database/vulnerability/litespeed-cache/wordpress-litespeed-cache-plugin-6-3-0-1-unauthenticated-privilege-escalation-vulnerability?_s_id=cve |
| 13 | CVE-2024-7885 | 7.5  | HIGH | A vulnerability was found in Undertow where the ProxyProtocolReadListener reuses the same StringBuilder instance across multiple requests. This issue occurs when the parseProxyProtocolV1 method processes multiple requests on the same HTTP connection. As a result, different requests may share the same StringBuilder instance, potentially leading to information leakage between requests or responses. In some cases, a value from a previous request or response may be erroneously reused, which could lead to unintended data exposure. This issue primarily results in errors and connection termination but creates a risk of data leakage in multi-request environments. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-7885<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2305290 |
| 14 | CVE-2024-8007 | 7.5  | HIGH | A flaw was found in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) director. This vulnerability allows an attacker to deploy potentially compromised container images via disabling TLS certificate verification for registry mirrors, which could enable a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-8007<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2305975 |
| 15 | CVE-2024-43410 | 7.5  | HIGH | Russh is a Rust SSH client & server library. Allocating an untrusted amount of memory allows any unauthenticated user to OOM a russh server. An SSH packet consists of a 4-byte big-endian length, followed by a byte stream of this length.After parsing and potentially decrypting the 4-byte length, russh allocates enough memory for this bytestream, as a performance optimization to avoid reallocations later. But this length is entirely untrusted and can be set to any value by the client, causing this much memory to be allocated, which will cause the process to OOM within a few such requests. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.44.1. | [1]https://github.com/Eugeny/russh/commit/f660ea3f64b86d11d19e33076012069f02431e55<br>[2]https://github.com/Eugeny/russh/security/advisories/GHSA-vgvv-x7xg-6cqg |
