| 1 | CVE-2025-13066 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Demo Importer Plus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file upload in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.6. This is due to insufficient file type validation detecting WXR files, allowing double extension files to bypass sanitization while being accepted as a valid WXR file. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3400301/demo-importer-plus/trunk/inc/importers<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/7df0ea8a-5e2c-4f5e-a326-b92df37ffa3c?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2025-13313 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The CRM Memberships plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via password reset in all versions up to, and including, 2.5. This is due to missing authorization and authentication checks on the `ntzcrm_changepassword` AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset arbitrary user passwords and gain unauthorized access to user accounts via the `ntzcrm_changepassword` endpoint, granted they can obtain or enumerate a target user`s email address. The plugin also exposes the `ntzcrm_get_users` endpoint without authentication, allowing attackers to enumerate subscriber email addresses, facilitating the exploitation of the password reset vulnerability. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/crm-memberships/tags/2.5/includes/class/class-ntzcrm-api.php#L12<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/crm-memberships/tags/2.5/includes/class/class-ntzcrm-api.php#L63<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/crm-memberships/tags/2.5/includes/class/class-ntzcrm-api.php#L795<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/crm-memberships/tags/2.5/includes/class/class-ntzcrm-dbquery.php#L287<br>[5]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/crm-memberships/tags/2.5/ntzcrm-memberships.php#L42<br>[6]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e2837399-c44f-494e-bdc6-f9c6e4e2dc11?source=cve |

| 24 | CVE-2025-66570 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | cpp-httplib is a C++11 single-file header-only cross platform HTTP/HTTPS library. Prior to 0.27.0, a vulnerability allows attacker-controlled HTTP headers to influence server-visible metadata, logging, and authorization decisions. An attacker can inject headers named REMOTE_ADDR, REMOTE_PORT, LOCAL_ADDR, LOCAL_PORT that are parsed into the request header multimap via read_headers() in httplib.h (headers.emplace), then the server later appends its own internal metadata using the same header names in Server::process_request without erasing duplicates. Because Request::get_header_value returns the first entry for a header key (id == 0) and the client-supplied headers are parsed before server-inserted headers, downstream code that uses these header names may inadvertently use attacker-controlled values. Affected files/locations: cpp-httplib/httplib.h (read_headers, Server::process_request, Request::get_header_value, get_header_value_u64) and cpp-httplib/docker/main.cc (get_client_ip, nginx_access_logger, nginx_error_logger). Attack surface: attacker-controlled HTTP headers in incoming requests flow into the Request.headers multimap and into logging code that reads forwarded headers, enabling IP spoofing, log poisoning, and authorization bypass via header shadowing. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.27.0. | [1]https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib/commit/ac9ebb0ee333ce8bf13523f487bdfad9518a2aff<br>[2]https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib/security/advisories/GHSA-xm2j-vfr9-mg9m |
| 25 | CVE-2025-66623 | 7.4  | HIGH | Strimzi provides a way to run an Apache Kafka cluster on Kubernetes or OpenShift in various deployment configurations. From 0.47.0 and prior to 0.49.1, in some situations, Strimzi creates an incorrect Kubernetes Role which grants the Apache Kafka Connect and Apache Kafka MirrorMaker 2 operands the GET access to all Kubernetes Secrets that exist in the given Kubernetes namespace. The issue is fixed in Strimzi 0.49.1. | [1]https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/commit/c8a14935e99c91eb0dd865431f46515da9f82ccc<br>[2]https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/security/advisories/GHSA-xrhh-hx36-485q |
| 26 | CVE-2025-66624 | 7.5  | HIGH | BACnet Protocol Stack library provides a BACnet application layer, network layer and media access (MAC) layer communications services. Prior to 1.5.0.rc2, The npdu_is_expected_reply function in src/bacnet/npdu.c indexes request_pdu[offset+2/3/5] and reply_pdu[offset+1/2/4] without verifying that those APDU bytes exist. bacnet_npdu_decode() can return offset == 2 for a 2-byte NPDU, so tiny PDUs pass the version check and then get read out of bounds. On ASan/MPU/strict builds this is an immediate crash (DoS). On unprotected builds it is undefined behavior and can mis-route replies; RCE is unlikely because only reads occur, but DoS is reliable. | [1]https://github.com/bacnet-stack/bacnet-stack/commit/9378f7d1e70169ebde4a5090bae7603703eadf48<br>[2]https://github.com/bacnet-stack/bacnet-stack/security/advisories/GHSA-8wgw-5h6x-qgqg |
