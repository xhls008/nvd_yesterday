| 15 | CVE-2024-7730 | 7.4  | HIGH | A heap buffer overflow was found in the virtio-snd device in QEMU. When reading input audio in the virtio-snd input callback, virtio_snd_pcm_in_cb, the function did not check whether the iov can fit the data buffer. This issue can trigger an out-of-bounds write if the size of the virtio queue element is equal to virtio_snd_pcm_status, which makes the available space for audio data zero. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-7730<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2304289 |
| 16 | CVE-2024-10979 | 8.8  | HIGH | Incorrect control of environment variables in PostgreSQL PL/Perl allows an unprivileged database user to change sensitive process environment variables (e.g. PATH).  That often suffices to enable arbitrary code execution, even if the attacker lacks a database server operating system user.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.1, 16.5, 15.9, 14.14, 13.17, and 12.21 are affected. | [1]https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2024-10979/ |
| 17 | CVE-2024-10962 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Migration, Backup, Staging – WPvivid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 0.9.107 via deserialization of untrusted input in the `replace_row_data` and `replace_serialize_data` functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. An administrator must create a staging site to trigger the exploit. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpvivid-backuprestore/trunk/includes/staging/class-wpvivid-staging-copy-db-ex.php#L1104<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpvivid-backuprestore/trunk/includes/staging/class-wpvivid-staging-copy-db-ex.php#L1120<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3186082/<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/9b4eba78-29f2-4357-ab3c-7bc3c20e0e75?source=cve |

| 53 | CVE-2024-52308 | 8.0  | HIGH | The GitHub CLI version 2.6.1 and earlier are vulnerable to remote code execution through a malicious codespace SSH server when using `gh codespace ssh` or `gh codespace logs` commands. This has been patched in the cli v2.62.0.Developers connect to remote codespaces through an SSH server running within the devcontainer, which is generally provided through the [default devcontainer image](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers#using-the-default-dev-container-configuration). GitHub CLI [retrieves SSH connection details](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/30066b0042d0c5928d959e288144300cb28196c9/internal/codespaces/rpc/invoker.go#L230-L244), such as remote username, which is used in [executing `ssh` commands](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/e356c69a6f0125cfaac782c35acf77314f18908d/pkg/cmd/codespace/ssh.go#L263) for `gh codespace ssh` or `gh codespace logs` commands.This exploit occurs when a malicious third-party devcontainer contains a modified SSH server that injects `ssh` arguments within the SSH connection details. `gh codespace ssh` and `gh codespace logs` commands could execute arbitrary code on the user`s workstation if the remote username contains something like `-oProxyCommand="echo hacked" #`.  The `-oProxyCommand` flag causes `ssh` to execute the provided command while `#` shell comment causes any other `ssh` arguments to be ignored.In `2.62.0`, the remote username information is being validated before being used. | [1]https://github.com/cli/cli/security/advisories/GHSA-p2h2-3vg9-4p87 |
