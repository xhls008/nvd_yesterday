| 1 | CVE-2024-7047 | 7.7  | HIGH | A cross site scripting vulnerability exists in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 16.6 prior to 17.0.5, 17.1 prior to 17.1.3, 17.2 prior to 17.2.1 allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts under the context of the current logged in user. | [1]https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/455318 |
| 2 | CVE-2024-41705 | 7.1  | HIGH | A stored XSS issue was discovered in Archer Platform 6.8 before 2024.06. A remote authenticated malicious Archer user could potentially exploit this to store malicious HTML or JavaScript code in a trusted application data store. When victim users access the data store through their browsers, the malicious code gets executed by the web browser in the context of the vulnerable application. 6.14.P4 (6.14.0.4) and 6.13 P4 (6.13.0.4) are also fixed releases. This vulnerability is similar to, but not identical to, CVE-2023-30639. | [1]https://www.archerirm.community/t5/platform-announcements/announcing-archer-platform-release-2024-06/ta-p/722094<br>[2]https://www.archerirm.community/t5/platform-announcements/archer-update-for-multiple-vulnerabilities/ta-p/739717 |
| 3 | CVE-2024-41706 | 7.3  | HIGH | A stored XSS issue was discovered in Archer Platform 6 before version 2024.06. A remote authenticated malicious Archer user could potentially exploit this to store malicious HTML or JavaScript code in a trusted application data store. When victim users access the data store through their browsers, the malicious code gets executed by the web browser in the context of the vulnerable application. 6.14 P4 (6.14.0.4) is also a fixed release. | [1]https://www.archerirm.community/t5/platform-announcements/announcing-archer-platform-release-2024-06/ta-p/722094<br>[2]https://www.archerirm.community/t5/platform-announcements/archer-update-for-multiple-vulnerabilities/ta-p/739717 |
| 4 | CVE-2024-37084 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | In Spring Cloud Data Flow versions prior to 2.11.4,  a malicious user who has access to the Skipper server api can use a crafted upload request to write an arbitrary file to any location on the file system which could lead to compromising the server | [1]https://spring.io/security/cve-2024-37084 |
| 5 | CVE-2024-6589 | 8.8  | HIGH | The LearnPress – WordPress LMS Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.6.8.2 via the `render_content_block_template` function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/learnpress/tags/4.2.6.8.2/inc/block-template/class-block-template-archive-course.php#L28<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/learnpress/tags/4.2.6.8.2/inc/block-template/class-block-template-single-course.php#L28<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3124296/<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/ba79bf95-08f8-4aa6-968b-f76a09ce52b8?source=cve |

| 10 | CVE-2024-41808 | 8.8  | HIGH | The OpenObserve open-source observability platform provides the ability to filter logs in a dashboard by the values uploaded in a given log. However, all versions of the platform through 0.9.1 do not sanitize user input in the filter selection menu, which may result in complete account takeover. It has been noted that the front-end uses `DOMPurify` or Vue templating to escape cross-site scripting (XSS) extensively, however certain areas of the front end lack this XSS protection. When combining the missing protection with the insecure authentication handling that the front-end uses, a malicious user may be able to take over any victim`s account provided they meet the exploitation steps. As of time of publication, no patched version is available. | [1]https://github.com/openobserve/openobserve/security/advisories/GHSA-hx23-g7m8-h76j |
| 11 | CVE-2024-41809 | 7.2  | HIGH | OpenObserve is an open-source observability platform.
