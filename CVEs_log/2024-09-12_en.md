| 6 | CVE-2024-8253 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Post Grid and Gutenberg Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions 2.2.87 to 2.2.90. This is due to the plugin not properly restricting what user meta values can be updated and ensuring a form is active. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to update their user meta to become an administrator. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/post-grid/trunk/includes/blocks/form-wrap/functions.php#L3032<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3130155/post-grid/tags/2.2.87/includes/blocks/form-wrap/functions.php<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3146752/post-grid/tags/2.2.91/includes/blocks/form-wrap/functions.php<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/f5f18cae-b7f8-4afd-adfa-c616c63f9419?source=cve |
| 7 | CVE-2024-21529 | 8.2  | HIGH | Versions of the package dset before 3.1.4 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via the dset function due improper user input sanitization. This vulnerability allows the attacker to inject malicious object property using the built-in Object property __proto__, which is recursively assigned to all the objects in the program. | [1]https://github.com/lukeed/dset/commit/16d6154e085bef01e99f01330e5a421a7f098afa<br>[2]https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-DSET-7116691 |
| 8 | CVE-2024-43690 | 8.0  | HIGH | Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere(CWE-829) in the Command Centre Server and Workstations may allow an attacker to perform Remote Code Execution (RCE).This issue affects: Command Centre Server and Command Centre Workstations 9.10 prior to vEL9.10.1530 (MR2), 9.00 prior to vEL9.00.2168 (MR4), 8.90 prior to vEL8.90.2155 (MR5), 8.80 prior to vEL8.80.1938 (MR6), all versions of 8.70 and prior. | [1]https://security.gallagher.com/en-NZ/Security-Advisories/CVE-2024-43690 |
| 9 | CVE-2024-7626 | 8.1  | HIGH | The WP Delicious – Recipe Plugin for Food Bloggers (formerly Delicious Recipes) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file movement and reading due to insufficient file path validation in the save_edit_profile_details() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to move arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is moved (such as wp-config.php). This can also lead to the reading of arbitrary files that may contain sensitive information like wp-config.php. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/delicious-recipes/tags/1.6.7/src/dashboard/class-delicious-recipes-form-handler.php#L260<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/delicious-recipes/tags/1.6.7/src/dashboard/class-delicious-recipes-form-handler.php#L355<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3148996/delicious-recipes/trunk/src/dashboard/class-delicious-recipes-form-handler.php<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/3c98bb53-9f7e-4ab3-9676-e3dbfb4a0519?source=cve |
| 10 | CVE-2019-25212 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | The video carousel slider with lightbox plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the `id` parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.6 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?old_path=/wp-responsive-video-gallery-with-lightbox/tags/1.0.6&new_path=/wp-responsive-video-gallery-with-lightbox/tags/1.0.7&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=#file41<br>[2]https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-responsive-video-gallery-with-lightbox<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/85e70be3-3ed7-4ce1-a20c-046fb7c4ec31?source=cve |
| 11 | CVE-2024-8277 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The WooCommerce Photo Reviews Premium plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.13.2. This is due to the plugin not properly validating what user transient is being used in the login() function and not properly verifying the user`s identity. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as user that has dismissed an admin notice in the past 30 days, which is often an administrator. Alternatively, a user can log in as any user with any transient that has a valid user_id as the value, though it would be more difficult to exploit this successfully. | [1]https://codecanyon.net/item/woocommerce-photo-reviews/21245349<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/a1e2d370-a716-4d6b-8e23-74db2fbd0760?source=cve |
