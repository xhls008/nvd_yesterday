| 59 | CVE-2025-58353 | 8.2  | HIGH | Promptcraft Forge Studio is a toolkit for evaluating, optimizing, and maintaining  LLM-powered applications. All versions of Promptcraft Forge Studio sanitize user input using regex blacklists such as r`eplace(/javascript:/gi, ``)`. Because the package uses multi-character tokens and each replacement is applied only once, removing one occurrence can create a new dangerous token due to overlap. The “sanitized” value may still contain an executable payload when used in href/src (or injected into the DOM). There is currently no fix for this issue. | [1]https://github.com/MarceloTessaro/promptcraft-forge-studio/security/advisories/GHSA-mv25-7v95-q3pf |
| 60 | CVE-2025-58361 | 9.3  | CRITICAL | Promptcraft Forge Studio is a toolkit for evaluating, optimizing, and maintaining  LLM-powered applications. All versions contain an non-exhaustive URL scheme check that does not protect against XSS. User-controlled URLs pass through src/utils/validation.ts, but the check only strips `javascript:` and a few patterns. `data:` URLs (for example data:image/svg+xml,…) still pass. If a sanitized value is used in href/src, an attacker can execute a script. There is currently no fix for this issue. | [1]https://github.com/MarceloTessaro/promptcraft-forge-studio/security/advisories/GHSA-fjch-4g87-g4p4 |

| 62 | CVE-2025-55190 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. In versions 2.13.0 through 2.13.8, 2.14.0 through 2.14.15, 3.0.0 through 3.0.12 and 3.1.0-rc1 through 3.1.1, API tokens with project-level permissions are able to retrieve sensitive repository credentials (usernames, passwords) through the project details API endpoint, even when the token only has standard application management permissions and no explicit access to secrets. This vulnerability does not only affect project-level permissions. Any token with project get permissions is also vulnerable, including global permissions such as: `p, role/user, projects, get, *, allow`. This issue is fixed in versions 2.13.9, 2.14.16, 3.0.14 and 3.1.2. | [1]https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/e8f86101f5378662ae6151ce5c3a76e9141900e8<br>[2]https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-786q-9hcg-v9ff |
