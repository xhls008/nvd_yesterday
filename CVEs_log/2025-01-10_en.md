| 22 | CVE-2024-43659 | 7.2  | HIGH | After gaining access to the firmware of a charging station, a file at <redacted> can be accessed to obtain default credentials that are the same across all Iocharger AC model EV chargers.This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC models before firmware version 25010801. The issue is addressed by requiring a mandatory password change on first login, it is still recommended to change the password on older models.Likelihood: Moderate – The attacker will first have to abuse a code execution or file inclusion vulnerability (for example by using <redacted>.sh) to gain access to the <redacted>.json file, or obtain a firmware dump of the charging station or obtain the firmware via other channels.Impact: Critical – All chargers using Iocharger firmware for AC models started with the same initial password. For models with firmware version before 25010801 a password change was not mandatory. It is therefore very likely that this firmware password is still active on many chargers. These credentials could, once obtained, allow an attacker to log into many Iocharger charging station, and allow them to execute arbitrary commands via the System → Custom page.CVSS clarification: Any network interface serving the web ui is vulnerable (AV:N) and there are not additional security measures to circumvent (AC:L), nor does the attack require and existing preconditions (AT:N). The attack is authenticated, and requires high privileges (PR:H), there is no user interaction required (UI:N). The attack leads to a compromised of the confidentialy of the "super user" credentials of the device (VC:H/VI:N/VA:N), and can subsequently be used to full compromise and other devices (SC:H/SI:H/SA:H).

The attack does require authentication, but the level of authentication is irrelevant (PR:L), it does not require user interaction (UI:N). The confidentiality of all files of the devicd can be compromised (VC:H/VI:N/VA:N).  There is no impact on subsequent systems. (SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).

| 24 | CVE-2024-43661 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The <redacted>.so library, which is used by <redacted>, isvulnerable to a buffer overflow in the code that handles the deletionof certificates. This buffer overflow can be triggered by providing along file path to the <redacted> action of the <redacted>.exe CGI binary orto the <redacted>.sh CGI script. This binary or script will write thisfile path to <redacted>, which is thenread by <redacted>.soThis issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC models before version 24120701.Likelihood: Moderate – An attacker will have to find this exploit byeither obtaining the binaries involved in this vulnerability, or by trialand error. Furthermore, the attacker will need a (low privilege)account to gain access to the <redacted>.exe CGI binary or <redacted>.shscript to trigger the vulnerability, or convince a user with such accesssend an HTTP request that triggers it.Impact: High – The <redacted> process, which we assume isresponsible for OCPP communication, will keep crashing afterperforming the exploit. This happens because the buffer overflowcauses the process to segfault before<redacted> is removed. This means that,even though <redacted> is automatically restarted, it will crashagain as soon as it tries to parse the text file.CVSS clarification. The attack can be executed over any network connection the station is listening to and serves the web interface (AV:N), and there are no additional security measure sin place that need to be circumvented (AC:L), the attack does not rely on preconditions (AT:N). The attack does require authentication, but the level of authentication is irrelevant (PR:L), it does not require user interaction (UI:N). The attack leads to reducred availability of the device (VC:N/VI:N/VA:H). THere is not impact on subsequent systems. (SC:N/SI:N/SA:N). Alltough this device is an EV charger handing significant amounts of power, we do not forsee a safety impact. The attack can be automated (AU:Y). Because the DoS condition is written to disk persistantly, it cannot be recovered by the user (R:I). | [1]https://csirt.divd.nl/CVE-2024-43661/<br>[2]https://csirt.divd.nl/DIVD-2024-00035/<br>[3]https://iocharger.com |
| 25 | CVE-2024-43663 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | There are many buffer overflow vulnerabilities present in several CGI binaries of the charging station.This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC model chargers beforeversion 24120701.Likelihood: High – Given the prevalence of these buffer overflows, and the clear error message of the web server, an attacker is very likely to be able to find these vulnerabilities.Impact: Low – Usually, overflowing one of these buffers just causes a segmentation fault of the CGI binary, which causes the web server to return a 502 Bad Gateway error. However the webserver itself is not affected, and no DoS can be achieved. Abusing these buffer overflows in a meaningful way requires highly technical knowledge, especially since ASLR also seems to be enabled on the charging station. However, a skilled attacker might be able to use one of these buffer overflows to obtain remote code execution.CVSS clarification. The attack can be executed over any network connection the station is listening to and serves the web interface (AV:N), and there are no additional security measure sin place that need to be circumvented (AC:L), the attack does not rely on preconditions (AT:N). The attack does require authentication, but the level of authentication is irrelevant (PR:L), it does not require user interaction (UI:N). The attack has a small impact on the availability of the device (VC:N/VI:N/VA:L).  There is no impact on subsequent systems. (SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).
