| 6 | CVE-2025-12903 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Payment Plugins Braintree For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the wc-braintree/v1/3ds/vaulted_nonce REST API endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.78. This is due to the endpoint being registered with permission_callback set to __return_true and processing user-supplied token IDs without verifying ownership or authentication. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve payment method nonces for any stored payment token in the system, which can be used to create fraudulent transactions, charge customer credit cards, or attach payment methods to other subscriptions. | [1]https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/using-the-rest-api/authentication/<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woo-payment-gateway/tags/3.2.78/includes/api/class-wc-braintree-controller-3ds.php#L23<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woo-payment-gateway/tags/3.2.78/includes/api/class-wc-braintree-controller-3ds.php#L35<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woo-payment-gateway/tags/3.2.78/includes/api/class-wc-braintree-controller-3ds.php#L41<br>[5]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3392259%40woo-payment-gateway&new=3392259%40woo-payment-gateway&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[6]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/89cd5429-39a0-441f-ba69-dea111eae5ed?source=cve |

The Operator creates a ServiceAccount with *ClusterRole* upon deployment of the *Namespace-Scoped* Custom Resource MonitorStack. This issue allows an adversarial Kubernetes Account with only namespaced-level roles, for example, a tenant controlling a namespace, to create a MonitorStack in the authorized namespace and then elevate permission to the cluster level by impersonating the ServiceAccount created by the Operator, resulting in privilege escalation and other issues. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:21146<br>[2]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-2843<br>[3]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2355222 |
| 18 | CVE-2025-59088 | 8.6  | HIGH | If kdcproxy receives a request for a realm which does not have server addresses defined in its configuration, by default, it will query SRV records in the DNS zone matching the requested realm name. This creates a server-side request forgery vulnerability, since an attacker could send a request for a realm matching a DNS zone where they created SRV records pointing to arbitrary ports and hostnames (which may resolve to loopback or internal IP addresses). This vulnerability can be exploited to probe internal network topology and firewall rules, perform port scanning, and exfiltrate data. Deployments wherethe "use_dns" setting is explicitly set to false are not affected. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:21138<br>[2]https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:21139<br>[3]https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:21140<br>[4]https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:21141<br>[5]https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:21142<br>[6]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-59088<br>[7]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2393955<br>[8]https://github.com/latchset/kdcproxy/pull/68 |

| 30 | CVE-2025-64186 | 8.7  | HIGH | Evervault is a payment security solution. A vulnerability was identified in the `evervault-go` SDK’s attestation verification logic in versions of `evervault-go` prior to 1.3.2 that may allow incomplete documents to pass validation. This may cause the client to trust an enclave operator that does not meet expected integrity guarantees. The exploitability of this issue is limited in Evervault-hosted environments as an attacker would require the pre-requisite ability to serve requests from specific evervault domain names, following from our ACME challenge based TLS certificate acquisition pipeline. The vulnerability primarily affects applications which only check PCR8. Though the efficacy is also reduced for applications that check all PCR values, the impact is largely remediated by checking PCR 0, 1 and 2. The identified issue has been addressed in version 1.3.2 by validating attestation documents before storing in the cache, and replacing the naive equality checks with a new SatisfiedBy check. Those who useevervault-go to attest Enclaves that are hosted outside of Evervault environments and cannot upgrade have two possible workarounds available. Modify the application logic to fail verification if PCR8 is not explicitly present and non-empty and/or add custom pre-validation to reject documents that omit any required PCRs. | [1]https://github.com/evervault/evervault-go/commit/7c824d289bba11ec0bea46a338023f5b128bbb28<br>[2]https://github.com/evervault/evervault-go/pull/48<br>[3]https://github.com/evervault/evervault-go/security/advisories/GHSA-88h9-77c7-p6w4 |
| 31 | CVE-2025-64500 | 7.3  | HIGH | Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Symfony`s HttpFoundation component defines an object-oriented layer for the HTTP specification. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 5.4.50, 6.4.29, and 7.3.7, the `Request` class improperly interprets some `PATH_INFO` in a way that leads to representing some URLs with a path that doesn`t start with a `/`. This can allow bypassing some access control rules that are built with this `/`-prefix assumption. Starting in versions 5.4.50, 6.4.29, and 7.3.7, the `Request` class now ensures that URL paths always start with a `/`. | [1]https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/symfony/http-foundation/CVE-2025-64500.yaml<br>[2]https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/symfony/symfony/CVE-2025-64500.yaml<br>[3]https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/9962b91b12bb791322fa73836b350836b6db7cac<br>[4]https://github.com/symfony/symfony/security/advisories/GHSA-3rg7-wf37-54rm<br>[5]https://symfony.com/blog/cve-2025-64500-incorrect-parsing-of-path-info-can-lead-to-limited-authorization-bypass |
