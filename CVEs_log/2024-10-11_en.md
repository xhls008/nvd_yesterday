|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2024-9518 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The UserPlus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions up to, and including, 2.0 due to insufficient restriction on the `form_actions` and `userplus_update_user_profile` functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to specify their user role by supplying the `role` parameter during a registration. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/userplus/trunk/functions/user-functions.php?rev=1604604#L47<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/2489e649-27f7-4ca0-8655-0957016fa89a?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2024-9519 | 7.2  | HIGH | The UserPlus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to an improper capability check on the `save_metabox_form` function in versions up to, and including, 2.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level permissions or above, to update the registration form role to administrator, which leads to privilege escalation. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/userplus/trunk/admin/admin-post-metaboxes.php?rev=1627771#L62<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/1148b18d-7af1-41c6-bd7f-1b2d53cb44e6?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2024-9522 | 8.8  | HIGH | The WP Users Masquerade plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 2.0.0. This is due to incorrect authentication and capability checking in the `ajax_masq_login` function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-users-masquerade/trunk/masquerade.php?rev=1703860#L162<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/4a4f0909-76f6-4d27-87b1-f6cd5f5cbbb7?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2024-9581 | 7.3  | HIGH | The Shortcodes AnyWhere plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/shortcodes-anywhere/trunk/core/shortcodeEverywhere.class.php#L15<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/7e289b06-66c8-4d50-a8f7-e07c5ae8f7c8?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2024-9022 | 7.2  | HIGH | The TS Poll – Survey, Versus Poll, Image Poll, Video Poll plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the ‘orderby’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.9 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://github.com/capture0x/Poll-Plugin-SQL-Injection-<br>[2]https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/179414/WordPress-Poll-2.3.6-SQL-Injection.html<br>[3]https://total-soft.com/wp-poll/<br>[4]https://wordpress.org/plugins/poll-wp/#developers<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d16363d6-ca4b-4de0-abae-a7b07803e2e3?source=cve |
