| 12 | CVE-2024-40631 | 8.1  | HIGH | Plate media is an open source, rich-text editor for React. Editors that use `MediaEmbedElement` and pass custom `urlParsers` to the `useMediaState` hook may be vulnerable to XSS if a custom parser allows `javascript:`, `data:` or `vbscript:` URLs to be embedded. Editors that do not use `urlParsers` and consume the `url` property directly may also be vulnerable if the URL is not sanitised. The default parsers `parseTwitterUrl` and `parseVideoUrl` are not affected. `@udecode/plate-media` 36.0.10 resolves this issue by only allowing HTTP and HTTPS URLs during parsing. This affects only the `embed` property returned from `useMediaState`. In addition, the `url` property returned from `useMediaState` has been renamed to `unsafeUrl` to indicate that it has not been sanitised. The `url` property on `element` is also unsafe, but has not been renamed. If you`re using either of these properties directly, you will still need to validate the URL yourself. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any custom `urlParsers` do not allow `javascript:`, `data:` or `vbscript:` URLs to be returned in the `url` property of their return values. If `url` is consumed directly, validate the URL protocol before passing it to the `iframe` element. | [1]https://github.com/udecode/plate/commit/1bc0971774fbfb770780c9bdb94746a6f0f196a0<br>[2]https://github.com/udecode/plate/security/advisories/GHSA-h3pq-667x-r789<br>[3]https://stackoverflow.com/a/43467144 |
| 13 | CVE-2024-39915 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | Thruk is a multibackend monitoring webinterface for Naemon, Nagios, Icinga and Shinken using the Livestatus API. This authenticated RCE in Thruk allows authorized users with network access to inject arbitrary commands via the URL parameter during PDF report generation. The Thruk web application does not properly process the url parameter when generating a PDF report. An authorized attacker with access to the reporting functionality could inject arbitrary commands that would be executed when the script /script/html2pdf.sh is called. The vulnerability can be exploited by an authorized user with network access. This issue has been addressed in version 3.16. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/sni/Thruk/commit/7e7eb251e76718a07639c4781f0d959d817f173b<br>[2]https://github.com/sni/Thruk/security/advisories/GHSA-r7gx-h738-4w6f |
| 14 | CVE-2024-40624 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | TorrentPier is an open source BitTorrent Public/Private tracker engine, written in php. In `torrentpier/library/includes/functions.php`, `get_tracks()` uses the unsafe native PHP serialization format to deserialize user-controlled cookies. One can use phpggc and the chain Guzzle/FW1 to write PHP code to an arbitrary file, and execute commands on the system. For instance, the cookie bb_t will be deserialized when browsing to viewforum.php. This issue has been addressed in commit `ed37e6e52` which is expected to be included in release version 2.4.4. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as the new release is available. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/torrentpier/torrentpier/blob/84f6c9f4a081d9ffff4c233098758280304bf50f/library/includes/functions.php#L41-L60<br>[2]https://github.com/torrentpier/torrentpier/commit/ed37e6e522f345f2b46147c6f53c1ab6dec1db9e<br>[3]https://github.com/torrentpier/torrentpier/security/advisories/GHSA-fg86-4c2r-7wxw |
