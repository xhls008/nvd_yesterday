| 15 | CVE-2025-63680 | 8.6  | HIGH | Nero BackItUp in the Nero Productline is vulnerable to a path parsing/UI rendering flaw (CWE-22) that, in combination with Windows ShellExecuteW fallback extension resolution, leads to arbitrary code execution when a user clicks a crafted entry. By creating a trailing-dot folder and placing a same-basename script, Nero BackItUp renders the file as a folder icon and then invokes ShellExecuteW, which executes the script via PATHEXT fallback (.COM/.EXE/.BAT/.CMD). The issue affects recent Nero BackItUp product lines (2019-2025 and earlier) and has been acknowledged by the vendor. | [1]https://github.com/PotatoHamm/Nero-Productline-Vulnerability |
| 16 | CVE-2025-13033 | 7.5  | HIGH | A vulnerability was identified in the email parsing library due to improper handling of specially formatted recipient email addresses. An attacker can exploit this flaw by crafting a recipient address that embeds an external address within quotes. This causes the application to misdirect the email to the attacker`s external address instead of the intended internal recipient. This could lead to a significant data leak of sensitive information and allow an attacker to bypass security filters and access controls. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-13033<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2402179<br>[3]https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer<br>[4]https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer/commit/1150d99fba77280df2cfb1885c43df23109a8626<br>[5]https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer/security/advisories/GHSA-mm7p-fcc7-pg87 |
