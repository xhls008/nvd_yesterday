| 16 | CVE-2025-36853 | 7.5  | HIGH | A vulnerability (CVE-2025-21172) exists in msdia140.dll due to integer overflow and heap-based overflow. Per CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow, a heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().‍ Per CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound, is when a product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This occurs when an integer value is incremented to a value that is too large to store in the associated representation. When this occurs, the value may become a very small or negative number. NOTE: This CVE affects only End Of Life (EOL) software components. The vendor, Microsoft, has indicated there will be no future updates nor support provided upon inquiry. | [1]https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-21172<br>[2]https://www.herodevs.com/vulnerability-directory/cve-2025-21172 |
| 17 | CVE-2025-36854 | 8.1  | HIGH | A vulnerability ( CVE-2024-38229 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord ) exists in EOL ASP.NET when closing an HTTP/3 stream while application code is writing to the response body, a race condition may lead to use-after-free, resulting in Remote Code Execution.  Per  CWE-416: Use After Free https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html , Use After Free is when a product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory "belongs" to the code that operates on the new pointer.  This issue affects EOL ASP.NET 6.0.0 <= 6.0.36 as represented in this CVE, as well as 8.0.0 <= 8.0.8, 9.0.0-preview.1.24081.5 <= 9.0.0.RC.1 as represented in  CVE-2024-38229 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord .  Additionally, if you`ve deployed  self-contained applications https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd  targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.   NOTE: This CVE only represents End Of Life (EOL) software components. The vendor, Microsoft, has indicated there will be no future updates nor support provided upon inquiry. | [1]https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-38229<br>[2]https://www.herodevs.com/vulnerability-directory/cve-2024-38229 |
| 18 | CVE-2025-36855 | 8.8  | HIGH | A vulnerability ( CVE-2025-21176 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord ) exists in DiaSymReader.dll due to buffer over-read. Per  CWE-126: Buffer Over-read https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/126.html , Buffer Over-read is when a product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.  This issue affects EOL ASP.NET 6.0.0 <= 6.0.36 as represented in this CVE, as well as 8.0.0 <= 8.0.11 & <= 9.0.0 as represented in CVE-2025-21176.  Additionally, if you`ve deployed  self-contained applications https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd  targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed. NOTE: This CVE affects only End Of Life (EOL) software components.

| 25 | CVE-2025-59033 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Microsoft vulnerable driver block list is implemented as Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policy. On systems that do not have hypervisor-protected code integrity (HVCI) enabled, entries that specify only the to-be-signed (TBS) part of the code signer certificate are properly blocked, but entries that specify the signing certificateâ€™s TBS hash along with a `FileAttribRef` qualifier (such as file name or version) will not be blocked. This vulnerability affects any Windows system that does not have HVCI enabled or supported (HVCI is available in Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server 2016 and later). NOTE: The vendor states that the driver blocklist is intended for use with HVCI, while systems without HVCI should use App Control, and any custom blocklist entries require a granular approach for proper enforcement. | [1]https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/app-control-for-business/design/microsoft-recommended-driver-block-rules<br>[2]https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/hardware-security/enable-virtualization-based-protection-of-code-integrity<br>[3]https://x.com/JonnyJohnson_/status/1895103112924307727 |

| 43 | CVE-2025-58745 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | WeGIA is a Web manager for charitable institutions. The fix for CVE-2025-22133 was not enough to remediate the arbitrary file upload vulnerability.
