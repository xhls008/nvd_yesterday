| 1 | CVE-2024-1929 | 7.5  | HIGH | Local Root Exploit via Configuration Dictionary  in dnf5daemon-server before 5.1.17 allows a malicious user to impact Confidentiality and Integrity via Configuration Dictionary.There are issues with the D-Bus interface long before Polkit is invoked. The `org.rpm.dnf.v0.SessionManager.open_session` method takes a key/value map of configuration entries. A sub-entry in this map, placed under the "config" key, is another key/value map. The configuration values found in it will be forwarded as configuration overrides to the `libdnf5::Base` configuration. Practically all libdnf5 configuration aspects can be influenced here. Already when opening the session via D-Bus, the libdnf5 will be initialized using these override configuration values. There is no sanity checking of the content of this "config" map, which is untrusted data. It is possible to make the library loading a plug-in shared library under control of an unprivileged user, hence achieving root access. | [1]https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/04/2 |
| 2 | CVE-2024-2746 | 8.8  | HIGH | Incomplete fix for CVE-2024-1929The problem with CVE-2024-1929 was that the dnf5 D-Bus daemon accepted arbitrary configuration parameters from unprivileged users, which allowed alocal root exploit by tricking the daemon into loading a user controlled "plugin". All of this happened before Polkit authentication was even started.The dnf5 library code does not check whether non-root users control the directory in question. On one hand, this poses a Denial-of-Service attack vector by making the daemonoperate on a blocking file (e.g. named FIFO special file) or a very large filethat causes an out-of-memory situation (e.g. /dev/zero). On the other hand, this can be used to let the daemon process privileged files like /etc/shadow.The file in question is parsed as an INI file. Error diagnostics resulting from parsing privileged files could cause information leaks, if these diagnosticsare accessible to unprivileged users. In the case of libdnf5, no such user accessible diagnostics should exist, though.Also, a local attacker can place a valid repository configuration file in this directory. This configuration file allows to specifya plethora of additional configuration options. This makes various additional code paths in libdnf5 accessible to the attacker. | [1]https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/5 |
| 3 | CVE-2024-2860 | 7.8  | HIGH | The PostgreSQL implementation in Brocade SANnav versions before 2.3.0a is vulnerable to an incorrect local authentication flaw.

| 4 | CVE-2024-4393 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Social Connect plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.2. This is due to insufficient verification on the OpenID server being supplied during the social login through the plugin. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the email. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/social-connect/tags/1.2/openid/openid.php#L575<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/2882d9dd-0c73-4c9a-99cb-d10900503103?source=cve |

| 19 | CVE-2024-32980 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | Spin is the developer tool for building and running serverless applications powered by WebAssembly. Prior to 2.4.3, some specifically configured Spin applications that use `self` requests without a specified URL authority can be induced to make requests to arbitrary hosts via the `Host` HTTP header. The following conditions need to be met for an application to be vulnerable: 1. The environment Spin is deployed in routes requests to the Spin runtime based on the request URL instead of the `Host` header, and leaves the `Host` header set to its original value; 2. The Spin application`s component handling the incoming request is configured with an `allow_outbound_hosts` list containing `"self"`; and 3. In reaction to an incoming request, the component makes an outbound request whose URL doesn`t include the hostname/port. Spin 2.4.3 has been released to fix this issue. | [1]https://github.com/fermyon/spin/commit/b3db535c9edb72278d4db3a201f0ed214e561354<br>[2]https://github.com/fermyon/spin/security/advisories/GHSA-f3h7-gpjj-wcvh |

| 21 | CVE-2024-34347 | 8.3  | HIGH | @hoppscotch/cli is a CLI to run Hoppscotch Test Scripts in CI environments. Prior to 0.8.0, the @hoppscotch/js-sandbox package provides a Javascript sandbox that uses the Node.js vm module. However, the vm module is not safe for sandboxing untrusted Javascript code. This is because code inside the vm context can break out if it can get a hold of any reference to an object created outside of the vm. In the case of @hoppscotch/js-sandbox, multiple references to external objects are passed into the vm context to allow pre-request scripts interactions with environment variables and more. But this also allows the pre-request script to escape the sandbox. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.8.0. | [1]https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch/commit/22c6eabd133195d22874250a5ae40cb26b851b01<br>[2]https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch/security/advisories/GHSA-qmmm-73r2-f8xr |
