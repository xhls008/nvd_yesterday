| 1 | CVE-2025-24286 | 7.2  | HIGH | A vulnerability allowing an authenticated user with the Backup Operator role to modify backup jobs, which could execute arbitrary code. | [1]https://www.veeam.com/kb4743 |
| 2 | CVE-2025-52467 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | pgai is a Python library that transforms PostgreSQL into a retrieval engine for RAG and Agentic applications. Prior to commit 8eb3567, the pgai repository was vulnerable to an attack allowing the exfiltration of all secrets used in one workflow. In particular, the GITHUB_TOKEN with write permissions for the repository, allowing an attacker to tamper with all aspects of the repository, including pushing arbitrary code and releases. This issue has been patched in commit 8eb3567. | [1]https://github.com/timescale/pgai/commit/8eb356729c33560ce54b88b9a956960ad1e3ede8<br>[2]https://github.com/timescale/pgai/pull/742<br>[3]https://github.com/timescale/pgai/security/advisories/GHSA-89qq-hgvp-x37m |
| 3 | CVE-2025-50201 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | WeGIA is a web manager for charitable institutions. Prior to version 3.4.2, an OS Command Injection vulnerability was identified in the /html/configuracao/debug_info.php endpoint. The branch parameter is not properly sanitized before being concatenated and executed in a shell command on the server`s operating system. This flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web server user (www-data). This issue has been patched in version 3.4.2. | [1]https://github.com/LabRedesCefetRJ/WeGIA/commit/45f32ad1d52775fc99f3c90075c8136c6d4d1d3d<br>[2]https://github.com/LabRedesCefetRJ/WeGIA/security/advisories/GHSA-52p5-5fmw-9hrf |
| 4 | CVE-2025-5071 | 8.8  | HIGH | The AI Engine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data and loss of data due to a missing capability check on the `Meow_MWAI_Labs_MCP::can_access_mcp` function in versions 2.8.0 to 2.8.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to have full access to the MCP and run various commands like `wp_create_user`, `wp_update_user` and `wp_update_option`, which can be used for privilege escalation, and `wp_update_post`, `wp_delete_post`, `wp_update_comment` and `wp_delete_comment`, which can be used to edit and delete posts and comments. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ai-engine/tags/2.8.1/labs/mcp.php#L43<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3313554/ai-engine#file21<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0e7654a1-0020-4bf1-86be-bdb238a9fe0d?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2025-6019 | 7.0  | HIGH | A Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) vulnerability was found in libblockdev. Generally, the "allow_active" setting in Polkit permits a physically present user to take certain actions based on the session type. Due to the way libblockdev interacts with the udisks daemon, an "allow_active" user on a system may be able escalate to full root privileges on the target host. Normally, udisks mounts user-provided filesystem images with security flags like nosuid and nodev to prevent privilege escalation.  However, a local attacker can create a specially crafted XFS image containing a SUID-root shell, then trick udisks into resizing it. This mounts their malicious filesystem with root privileges, allowing them to execute their SUID-root shell and gain complete control of the system. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-6019<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2370051<br>[3]http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/06/17/5<br>[4]http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/06/17/6<br>[5]http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/06/18/1<br>[6]https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/06/msg00018.html |
