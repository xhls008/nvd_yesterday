| 11 | CVE-2024-27299 | 8.8  | HIGH | phpMyFAQ is an open source FAQ web application for PHP 8.1+ and MySQL, PostgreSQL and other databases. A SQL injection vulnerability has been discovered in the the "Add News" functionality due to improper escaping of the email address. This allows any authenticated user with the rights to add/edit FAQ news to exploit this vulnerability to exfiltrate data, take over accounts and in some cases, even achieve RCE. The vulnerable field lies in the  `authorEmail` field which uses PHP`s `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL` filter. This filter is insufficient in protecting against SQL injection attacks and should still be properly escaped. However, in this version of phpMyFAQ (3.2.5), this field is not escaped properly can be used together with other fields to fully exploit the SQL injection vulnerability. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.2.6. | [1]https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BFL8GHIBxSUxu0TneYf66KjFA0A4RZga?usp=sharing<br>[2]https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/commit/1b68a5f89fb65996c56285fa636b818de8608011<br>[3]https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/security/advisories/GHSA-qgxx-4xv5-6hcw |
| 12 | CVE-2024-28105 | 7.2  | HIGH | phpMyFAQ is an open source FAQ web application for PHP 8.1+ and MySQL, PostgreSQL and other databases. The category image upload function in phpmyfaq is vulnerable to manipulation of the `Content-type` and `lang` parameters, allowing attackers to upload malicious files with a .php extension, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE) on the system. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.2.6. | [1]https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/commit/9136883776af67dfdb0e8cf14f5e0ca22bf4f2e7<br>[2]https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/security/advisories/GHSA-pwh2-fpfr-x5gf |

| 14 | CVE-2024-28850 | 8.1  | HIGH | WP Crontrol controls the cron events on WordPress websites.  WP Crontrol includes a feature that allows administrative users to create events in the WP-Cron system that store and execute PHP code subject to the restrictive security permissions documented here. While there is no known vulnerability in this feature on its own, there exists potential for this feature to be vulnerable to RCE if it were specifically targeted via vulnerability chaining that exploited a separate SQLi (or similar) vulnerability. This is exploitable on a site if one of the below preconditions are met, the site is vulnerable to a writeable SQLi vulnerability in any plugin, theme, or WordPress core, the site`s database is compromised at the hosting level, the site is vulnerable to a method of updating arbitrary options in the wp_options table, or the site is vulnerable to a method of triggering an arbitrary action, filter, or function with control of the parameters.  As a hardening measure, WP Crontrol version 1.16.2 ships with a new feature that prevents tampering of the code stored in a PHP cron event. | [1]https://github.com/johnbillion/wp-crontrol/releases/tag/1.16.2<br>[2]https://github.com/johnbillion/wp-crontrol/security/advisories/GHSA-9xvf-cjvf-ff5q |
