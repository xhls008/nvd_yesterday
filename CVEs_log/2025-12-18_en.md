| 23 | CVE-2025-62521 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. Prior to version 5.21.0, a pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability in ChurchCRM`s setup wizard allows unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary PHP code during the initial installation process, leading to complete server compromise. The vulnerability exists in `setup/routes/setup.php` where user input from the setup form is directly concatenated into a PHP configuration template without any validation or sanitization. Any parameter in the setup form can be used to inject PHP code that gets written to `Include/Config.php`, which is then executed on every page load. This is more severe than typical authenticated RCE vulnerabilities because it requires no credentials and affects the installation process that administrators must complete. Version 5.21.0 patches the issue. | [1]https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/security/advisories/GHSA-m8jq-j3p9-2xf3 |
| 24 | CVE-2025-66395 | 8.8  | HIGH | ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. Prior to version 6.5.3, a SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `src/ListEvents.php` file. When filtering events by type, the `WhichType` POST parameter is not properly sanitized or type-casted before being used in multiple SQL queries. This allows any authenticated user to execute arbitrary SQL commands, including time-based blind SQL injection attacks. Any authenticated user, regardless of their privilege level, can execute arbitrary queries on the database. This could allow them to exfiltrate, modify, or delete any data in the database, including user credentials, financial data, and personal information, leading to a full compromise of the application`s data. Version 6.5.3 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/security/advisories/GHSA-c9xf-f3gr-xfwv<br>[2]https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/security/advisories/GHSA-c9xf-f3gr-xfwv |
| 25 | CVE-2025-67171 | 7.5  | HIGH | Incorrect access control in the /templates/ component of RiteCMS v3.1.0 allows attackers to access sensitive files via directory traversal. | [1]https://github.com/handylulu/RiteCMS/<br>[2]https://github.com/mbiesiad/vulnerability-research/tree/main/CVE-2025-67171 |
| 26 | CVE-2025-66396 | 7.2  | HIGH | ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. Prior to version 6.5.3, a SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `src/UserEditor.php` file. When an administrator saves a user`s configuration settings, the keys of the `type` POST parameter array are not properly sanitized or type-casted before being used in multiple SQL queries. This allows a malicious or compromised administrator account to execute arbitrary SQL commands, including time-based blind SQL injection attacks, to directly interact with the database. The vulnerability is located in `src/UserEditor.php` within the logic that handles saving user-specific configuration settings. The `type` parameter from the POST request is processed as an array. The code iterates through this array and uses `key($type)` to extract the array key, which is expected to be a numeric ID. This key is then assigned to the `$id` variable. The `$id` variable is subsequently concatenated directly into a `SELECT` and an `UPDATE` SQL query without any sanitization or validation, making it an injection vector. Although the vulnerability requires administrator privileges to exploit, it allows a malicious or compromised admin account to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This can be used to bypass any application-level logging or restrictions, directly manipulate the database, exfiltrate, modify, or delete all data (including other user credentials, financial records, and personal information), and could potentially lead to further system compromise, such as writing files to the server, depending on the database`s configuration and user privileges. Version 6.5.3 patches the issue. | [1]https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/security/advisories/GHSA-whpp-wx64-4qp9 |
| 27 | CVE-2025-66397 | 8.3  | HIGH | ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system.

| 51 | CVE-2025-66029 | 7.6  | HIGH | Open OnDemand provides remote web access to supercomputers. In versions 4.0.8 and prior, the Apache proxy allows sensitive headers to be passed to origin servers. This means malicious users can create an origin server on a compute node that record these headers when unsuspecting users connect to it. Maintainers anticipate a patch in a 4.1 release. Workarounds exist for 4.0.x versions. Using `custom_location_directives` in `ood_portal.yml` in version 4.0.x (not available for versions below 4.0) centers can unset and or edit these headers. Note that `OIDCPassClaimsAs both` is the default and centers can set `OIDCPassClaimsAs ` to `none` or `environment` to stop passing these headers to the client. Centers that have an OIDC provider with the `OIDCPassClaimsAs` with `none` or `environment` settings can adjust the settings using guidance provided in GHSA-2cwp-8g29-9q32 to unset the mod_auth_openidc_session cookies. | [1]https://github.com/OSC/ondemand/security/advisories/GHSA-2cwp-8g29-9q32 |
| 52 | CVE-2025-68147 | 8.1  | HIGH | Open Source Point of Sale (opensourcepos) is a web based point of sale application written in PHP using CodeIgniter framework. Starting in version 3.4.0 and prior to version 3.4.2, a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the "Return Policy" configuration field. The application does not properly sanitize user input before saving it to the database or displaying it on receipts. An attacker with access to the "Store Configuration" (such as a rogue administrator or an account compromised via the separate CSRF vulnerability) can inject malicious JavaScript payloads into this field. These payloads are executed in the browser of any user (including other administrators and sales staff) whenever they view a receipt or complete a transaction. This can lead to session hijacking, theft of sensitive data, or unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the victim. The vulnerability has been patched in version 3.4.2 by ensuring the output is escaped using the `esc()` function in the receipt template. As a temporary mitigation, administrators should ensure the "Return Policy" field contains only plain text and strictly avoid entering any HTML tags. There is no code-based workaround other than applying the patch. | [1]https://github.com/Nixon-H/CVE-2025-68147-OSPOS-Stored-XSS<br>[2]https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos/commit/22297a<br>[3]https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos/security/advisories/GHSA-xgr7-7pvw-fpmh |
| 53 | CVE-2025-68429 | 7.3  | HIGH | Storybook is a frontend workshop for building user interface components and pages in isolation. A vulnerability present starting in versions 7.0.0 and prior to versions 7.6.21, 8.6.15, 9.1.17, and 10.1.10 relates to Storybook’s handling of environment variables defined in a `.env` file, which could, in specific circumstances, lead to those variables being unexpectedly bundled into the artifacts created by the `storybook build` command. When a built Storybook is published to the web, the bundle’s source is viewable, thus potentially exposing those variables to anyone with access. For a project to potentially be vulnerable to this issue, it must build the Storybook (i.e. run `storybook build` directly or indirectly) in a directory that contains a `.env` file (including variants like `.env.local`) and publish the built Storybook to the web. Storybooks built without a `.env` file at build time are not affected, including common CI-based builds where secrets are provided via platform environment variables rather than `.env` files. Storybook runtime environments (i.e. `storybook dev`) are not affected. Deployed applications that share a repo with your Storybook are not affected. Users should upgrade their Storybook—on both their local machines and CI environment—to version .6.21, 8.6.15, 9.1.17, or 10.1.10 as soon as possible. Maintainers additionally recommend that users audit for any sensitive secrets provided via `.env` files and rotate those keys. Some projects may have been relying on the undocumented behavior at the heart of this issue and will need to change how they reference environment variables after this update. If a project can no longer read necessary environmental variable values, either prefix the variables with `STORYBOOK_` or use the `env` property in Storybook’s configuration to manually specify values. In either case, do not include sensitive secrets as they will be included in the built bundle. | [1]https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/security/advisories/GHSA-8452-54wp-rmv6<br>[2]https://storybook.js.org/blog/security-advisory |
| 54 | CVE-2025-68432 | 7.7  | HIGH | Zed, a code editor, has an aribtrary code execution vulnerability in versions prior to 0.218.2-pre. The Zed IDE loads Language Server Protocol (LSP) configurations from the `settings.json` file located within a project’s `.zed` subdirectory. A malicious LSP configuration can contain arbitrary shell commands that run on the host system with the privileges of the user running the IDE. This can be triggered when a user opens project file for which there is an LSP entry.  A concerted effort by an attacker to seed a project settings file (`./zed/settings.json`) with malicious language server configurations could result in arbitrary code execution with the user`s privileges if the user opens the project in Zed without reviewing the contents. Version 0.218.2-pre fixes the issue by implementing worktree trust mechanism. As a workaround, users should carefully review the contents of project settings files (`./zed/settings.json`) before opening new projects in Zed. | [1]https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/security/advisories/GHSA-29cp-2hmh-hcxj<br>[2]https://zed.dev/blog/secure-by-default |
| 55 | CVE-2025-68433 | 7.7  | HIGH | Zed, a code editor, has an aribtrary code execution vulnerability in versions prior to 0.218.2-pre. The Zed IDE loads Model Context Protocol (MCP) configurations from the `settings.json` file located within a project’s `.zed` subdirectory. A malicious MCP configuration can contain arbitrary shell commands that run on the host system with the privileges of the user running the IDE. This can be triggered automatically without any user interaction besides opening the project in the IDE. Version 0.218.2-pre fixes the issue by implementing worktree trust mechanism. As a workaround, users should carefully review the contents of project settings files (`./zed/settings.json`) before opening new projects in Zed. | [1]https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/security/advisories/GHSA-cv6g-cmxc-vw8j<br>[2]https://zed.dev/blog/secure-by-default |
| 56 | CVE-2025-68434 | 8.8  | HIGH | Open Source Point of Sale (opensourcepos) is a web based point of sale application written in PHP using CodeIgniter framework. Starting in version 3.4.0 and prior to version 3.4.2, a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the application`s filter configuration. The CSRF protection mechanism was **explicitly disabled**, allowing the application to process state-changing requests (POST) without verifying a valid CSRF token. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this by hosting a malicious web page. If a logged-in administrator visits this page, their browser is forced to send unauthorized requests to the application. A successful exploit allows the attacker to silently create a new Administrator account with full privileges, leading to a complete takeover of the system and loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The vulnerability has been patched in version 3.4.2. The fix re-enables the CSRF filter in `app/Config/Filters.php` and resolves associated AJAX race conditions by adjusting token regeneration settings. As a workaround, administrators can manually re-enable the CSRF filter in `app/Config/Filters.php` by uncommenting the protection line. However, this is not recommended without applying the full patch, as it may cause functionality breakage in the Sales module due to token synchronization issues. | [1]https://github.com/Nixon-H/CVE-2025-68434-OSPOS-CSRF-Unauthorized-Administrator-Creation<br>[2]https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos/commit/d575c8da9a1d7af8313a1e758e000e243f5614ef<br>[3]https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos/pull/4349<br>[4]https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos/security/advisories/GHSA-wjm4-hfwg-5w5r |
| 57 | CVE-2025-68435 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | Zerobyte is a backup automation tool Zerobyte versions prior to 0.18.5 and 0.19.0 contain an authentication bypass vulnerability where authentication middleware is not properly applied to API endpoints. This results in certain API endpoints being accessible without valid session credentials. This is dangerous for those who have exposed Zerobyte to be used outside of their internal network. A fix has been applied in both version 0.19.0 and 0.18.5.
