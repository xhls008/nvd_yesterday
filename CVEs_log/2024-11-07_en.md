| 1 | CVE-2024-10028 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Everest Backup – WordPress Cloud Backup, Migration, Restore & Cloning Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.13 via the exposed process stats file during the backup process. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to obtain an archive file name and download the site`s backup. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/everest-backup/tags/2.2.13/inc/classes/class-backup-directory.php#L514<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/9b871957-a2b3-492f-b461-7040d9098b2b?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2024-10020 | 8.1  | HIGH | The Heateor Social Login WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.35. This is due to insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, if they have access to the email and the user does not have an already-existing account for the service returning the token. An attacker cannot authenticate as an administrator by default, but these accounts are also at risk if authentication for administrators has explicitly been allowed via the social login. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3177729/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6b1d212b-75fe-4285-9c22-62b040e5a36c?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2024-9307 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | The mFolio Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to file uploads due to a missing capability check in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file or upload arbitrary EXE files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible if the attacker can also gain access to run the .exe file, or trick a site visitor into downloading and running the .exe file. | [1]https://wordpress.org/plugins/mfolio-lite/#developers<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/3b4012dd-7c0a-45f1-8ada-8f9dc6867e1e?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2024-9946 | 8.1  | HIGH | The Social Share, Social Login and Social Comments Plugin – Super Socializer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 7.13.68. This is due to insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, if they have access to the email and the user does not have an already-existing account for the service returning the token. An attacker cannot authenticate as an administrator by default, but these accounts are also at risk if authentication for administrators has explicitly been allowed via the social login.

| 11 | CVE-2024-10082 | 8.7  | HIGH | CodeChecker is an analyzer tooling, defect database and viewer extension for the Clang Static Analyzer and Clang Tidy. Authentication method confusion allows logging in as the built-in root user from an external service. The built-in root user up until 6.24.1 is generated in a weak manner, cannot be disabled, and has universal access.This vulnerability allows an attacker who can create an account on an enabled external authentication service, to log in as the root user, and access and control everything that can be controlled via the web interface. The attacker needs to acquire the username of the root user to be successful.This issue affects CodeChecker: through 6.24.1. | [1]https://github.com/Ericsson/codechecker/security/advisories/GHSA-fpm5-2wcj-vfr7 |
