| 27 | CVE-2024-28185 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | Judge0 is an open-source online code execution system. The application does not account for symlinks placed inside the sandbox directory, which can be leveraged by an attacker to write to arbitrary files and gain code execution outside of the sandbox. When executing a submission, Judge0 writes a `run_script` to the sandbox directory. The security issue is that an attacker can create a symbolic link (symlink) at the path `run_script` before this code is executed, resulting in the `f.write` writing to an arbitrary file on the unsandboxed system. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to overwrite scripts on the system and gain code execution outside of the sandbox. | [1]https://github.com/judge0/judge0/blob/v1.13.0/app/jobs/isolate_job.rb#L197-L201<br>[2]https://github.com/judge0/judge0/commit/846d5839026161bb299b7a35fd3b2afb107992fc<br>[3]https://github.com/judge0/judge0/security/advisories/GHSA-h9g2-45c8-89cf |
| 28 | CVE-2024-28189 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | Judge0 is an open-source online code execution system. The application uses the UNIX chown command on an untrusted file within the sandbox. An attacker can abuse this by creating a symbolic link (symlink) to a file outside the sandbox, allowing the attacker to run chown on arbitrary files outside of the sandbox. This vulnerability is not impactful on it`s own, but it can be used to bypass the patch for CVE-2024-28185 and obtain a complete sandbox escape. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.13.1. | [1]https://github.com/judge0/judge0/blob/v1.13.0/app/jobs/isolate_job.rb#L232<br>[2]https://github.com/judge0/judge0/commit/f3b8547b3b67863e4ea0ded3adcb963add56addd<br>[3]https://github.com/judge0/judge0/security/advisories/GHSA-3xpw-36v7-2cmg<br>[4]https://github.com/judge0/judge0/security/advisories/GHSA-h9g2-45c8-89cf |
| 29 | CVE-2024-29021 | 9.0  | CRITICAL | Judge0 is an open-source online code execution system. The default configuration of Judge0 leaves the service vulnerable to a sandbox escape via Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). This allows an attacker with sufficient access to the Judge0 API to obtain unsandboxed code execution as root on the target machine. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.13.1. | [1]https://github.com/judge0/judge0/blob/ad66f77b131dbbebf2b9ff8083dca9a68680b3e5/app/jobs/isolate_job.rb#L203-L230<br>[2]https://github.com/judge0/judge0/security/advisories/GHSA-q7vg-26pg-v5hr |

| 31 | CVE-2024-32475 | 7.5  | HIGH | Envoy is a cloud-native, open source edge and service proxy. When an upstream TLS cluster is used with `auto_sni` enabled, a request containing a `host`/`:authority` header longer than 255 characters triggers an abnormal termination of Envoy process. Envoy does not gracefully handle an error when setting SNI for outbound TLS connection. The error can occur when Envoy attempts to use the `host`/`:authority` header value longer than 255 characters as SNI for outbound TLS connection. SNI length is limited to 255 characters per the standard. Envoy always expects this operation to succeed and abnormally aborts the process when it fails. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.30.1, 1.29.4, 1.28.3, and 1.27.5. | [1]https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/b47fc6648d7c2dfe0093a601d44cb704b7bad382<br>[2]https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-3mh5-6q8v-25wj |
| 32 | CVE-2024-32462 | 8.4  | HIGH | Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux. in versions before 1.10.9, 1.12.9, 1.14.6, and 1.15.8, a malicious or compromised Flatpak app could execute arbitrary code outside its sandbox. Normally, the `--command` argument of `flatpak run` expects to be given a command to run in the specified Flatpak app, optionally along with some arguments. However it is possible to instead pass `bwrap` arguments to `--command=`, such as `--bind`. It`s possible to pass an arbitrary `commandline` to the portal interface `org.freedesktop.portal.Background.RequestBackground` from within a Flatpak app. When this is converted into a `--command` and arguments, it achieves the same effect of passing arguments directly to `bwrap`, and thus can be used for a sandbox escape. The solution is to pass the `--` argument to `bwrap`, which makes it stop processing options. This has been supported since bubblewrap 0.3.0. All supported versions of Flatpak require at least that version of bubblewrap. xdg-desktop-portal version 1.18.4 will mitigate this vulnerability by only allowing Flatpak apps to create .desktop files for commands that do not start with --. The vulnerability is patched in 1.15.8, 1.10.9, 1.12.9, and 1.14.6. | [1]https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/72016e3fce8fcbeab707daf4f1a02b931fcc004d<br>[2]https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/81abe2a37d363f5099c3d0bdcd0caad6efc5bf97<br>[3]https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/b7c1a558e58aaeb1d007d29529bbb270dc4ff11e<br>[4]https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/bbab7ed1e672356d1a78b422462b210e8e875931<br>[5]https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-phv6-cpc2-2fgj |

| 34 | CVE-2024-32474 | 7.3  | HIGH | Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Prior to 24.4.1, when authenticating as a superuser to Sentry with a username and password, the password is leaked as cleartext in logs under the _event_: `auth-index.validate_superuser`. An attacker with access to the log data could use these leaked credentials to login to the Sentry system as superuser. Self-hosted users on affected versions should upgrade to 24.4.1 or later. Users can configure the logging level to exclude logs of the `INFO` level and only generate logs for levels at `WARNING` or more. | [1]https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/d5b34568d9f1c41362ccb62141532a0a2169512f<br>[2]https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/66393<br>[3]https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/69148<br>[4]https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/security/advisories/GHSA-6cjm-4pxw-7xp9 |
| 35 | CVE-2024-32477 | 7.7  | HIGH | Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure defaults. By using ANSI escape sequences and a race between `libc::tcflush(0, libc::TCIFLUSH)` and reading standard input, it`s possible to manipulate the permission prompt and force it to allow an unsafe action regardless of the user input. Some ANSI escape sequences act as a info request to the master terminal emulator and the terminal emulator sends back the reply in the PTY channel. standard streams also use this channel to send and get data. For example the `\033[6n` sequence requests the current cursor position. These sequences allow us to append data to the standard input of Deno. This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass Deno permission policy.  This vulnerability is fixed in 1.42.2. | [1]https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-95cj-3hr2-7j5j |

| 38 | CVE-2024-1491 | 7.5  | HIGH | The devices allow access to an unprotected endpoint that allows MPFS file system binary image upload without authentication. The MPFS2 file system module provides a light-weight read-only file system that can be stored in external EEPROM, external serial flash, or internal flash program memory. This file system serves as the basis for the HTTP2 web server module, but is also used by the SNMP module and is available to other applications that require basic read-only storage capabilities. This can be exploited to overwrite the flash program memory that holds the web server`s main interfaces and execute arbitrary code. | [1]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-107-02 |
