| 7 | CVE-2025-67506 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | PipesHub is a fully extensible workplace AI platform for enterprise search and workflow automation. Versions prior to 0.1.0-beta expose POST /api/v1/record/buffer/convert through missing authentication. The endpoint accepts a file upload and converts it to PDF via LibreOffice by uploading payload to os.path.join(tmpdir, file.filename) without normalizing the filename. An attacker can submit a crafted filename containing ../ sequences to write arbitrary files anywhere the service account has permission, enabling remote file overwrite or planting malicious code. This issue is fixed in version 0.1.0-beta. | [1]https://github.com/pipeshub-ai/pipeshub-ai/commit/987ebab40a1fc39956730ed93220f7f9b2c4e5f8<br>[2]https://github.com/pipeshub-ai/pipeshub-ai/security/advisories/GHSA-w398-9m55-2357 |
| 8 | CVE-2025-67507 | 8.1  | HIGH | Filament is a collection of full-stack components for accelerated Laravel development.

| 9 | CVE-2025-13613 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Elated Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.2. This is due to the plugin not properly logging in a user with the data that was previously verified through the `eltdf_membership_check_facebook_user` and the `eltdf_membership_login_user_from_social_network` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as administrative users, as long as they have an existing account on the site which can easily be created by default through the temp user functionality, and access to the administrative user`s email. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/esmarts-a-modern-education-and-lms-theme/20987760<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/f15dbce4-2e94-4735-b62b-e32d923c51ce?source=cve |

| 33 | CVE-2025-66628 | 7.5  | HIGH | ImageMagick is a software suite to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images. In versions 7.1.2-9 and prior, the TIM (PSX TIM) image parser contains a critical integer overflow vulnerability in its ReadTIMImage function (coders/tim.c). The code reads width and height (16-bit values) from the file header and calculates image_size = 2 * width * height without checking for overflow. On 32-bit systems (or where size_t is 32-bit), this calculation can overflow if width and height are large (e.g., 65535), wrapping around to a small value. This results in a small heap allocation via AcquireQuantumMemory and later operations relying on the dimensions can trigger an out of bounds read. This issue is fixed in version 7.1.2-10. | [1]https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/security/advisories/GHSA-6hjr-v6g4-3fm8<br>[2]https://github.com/dlemstra/Magick.NET/commit/2dfa08e15cfd11016a79615994787b14f9048b1c |
| 34 | CVE-2025-67505 | 8.4  | HIGH | Okta Java Management SDK facilitates interactions with the Okta management API. In versions 11.0.0 through 20.0.0, race conditions may arise from concurrent requests using the ApiClient class. This could cause a status code or response header from one request’s response to influence another request’s response. This issue is fixed in version 20.0.1. | [1]https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-java/commit/abf4f128a0441f90cb7efcdcf4bde1aef8703243<br>[2]https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-java/security/advisories/GHSA-j5gq-897m-2rff |
| 35 | CVE-2025-67509 | 8.2  | HIGH | Neuron is a PHP framework for creating and orchestrating AI Agents. Versions 2.8.11 and below use MySQLSelectTool, which is vulnerable to Read-Only Bypass.  MySQLSelectTool is intended to be a read-only SQL tool (e.g., for LLM agent querying, however, validation based on the first keyword (e.g., SELECT) and a forbidden-keyword list does not block file-writing constructs such as INTO OUTFILE / INTO DUMPFILE. As a result, an attacker who can influence the tool input (e.g., via prompt injection through a public agent endpoint) may write arbitrary files to the DB server if the MySQL/MariaDB account has the FILE privilege and server configuration permits writes to a useful location (e.g., a web-accessible directory). This issue is fixed in version 2.8.12. | [1]https://github.com/neuron-core/neuron-ai/commit/72735d0ea133266cf2f5d5d195d41e9dd865289a<br>[2]https://github.com/neuron-core/neuron-ai/releases/tag/2.8.12<br>[3]https://github.com/neuron-core/neuron-ai/security/advisories/GHSA-j8g6-5gqc-mq36 |
| 36 | CVE-2025-67510 | 9.4  | CRITICAL | Neuron is a PHP framework for creating and orchestrating AI Agents. In versions 2.8.11 and below, the MySQLWriteTool executes arbitrary SQL provided by the caller using PDO::prepare() + execute() without semantic restrictions. This is consistent with the name (“write tool”), but in an LLM/agent context it becomes a high-risk capability: prompt injection or indirect prompt manipulation can cause execution of destructive queries such as DROP TABLE, TRUNCATE, DELETE, ALTER, or privilege-related statements (subject to DB permissions). Deployments that expose an agent with MySQLWriteTool enabled to untrusted input and/or run the tool with a DB user that has broad privileges are impacted. This issue is fixed in version 2.8.12. | [1]https://github.com/neuron-core/neuron-ai/commit/44bab85d92bf162898ee48d0bcef6ba0d29b59c9<br>[2]https://github.com/neuron-core/neuron-ai/releases/tag/2.8.12<br>[3]https://github.com/neuron-core/neuron-ai/security/advisories/GHSA-898v-775g-777c |
