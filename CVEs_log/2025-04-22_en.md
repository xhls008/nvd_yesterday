| 3 | CVE-2025-29659 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Yi IOT XY-3820 6.0.24.10 is vulnerable to Remote Command Execution via the "cmd_listen" function located in the "cmd" binary. | [1]https://github.com/Yasha-ops/RCE-YiIOT<br>[2]https://github.com/Yasha-ops/vulnerability-research/tree/master/CVE-2025-29659<br>[3]https://github.com/Yasha-ops/vulnerability-research/tree/master/CVE-2025-29659 |
| 4 | CVE-2025-29660 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | A vulnerability exists in the daemon process of the Yi IOT XY-3820 v6.0.24.10, which exposes a TCP service on port 6789. This service lacks proper input validation, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary scripts present on the device by sending specially crafted TCP requests using directory traversal techniques. | [1]https://github.com/Yasha-ops/RCE-YiIOT<br>[2]https://github.com/Yasha-ops/vulnerability-research/tree/master/CVE-2025-29660 |
| 5 | CVE-2025-3857 | 7.5  | HIGH | When reading binary Ion data through Amazon.IonDotnet using the RawBinaryReader class, Amazon.IonDotnet does not check the number of bytes read from the underlying stream while deserializing the binary format. If the Ion data is malformed or truncated, this triggers an infinite loop condition that could potentially result in a denial of service. Users should upgrade to Amazon.IonDotnet version 1.3.1 and ensure any forked or derivative code is patched to incorporate the new fixes. | [1]https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2025-009/<br>[2]https://github.com/amazon-ion/ion-dotnet/security/advisories/GHSA-gm2p-wf5c-w3pj |
| 6 | CVE-2025-43922 | 8.1  | HIGH | The FileWave Windows client before 16.0.0, in some non-default configurations, allows an unprivileged local user to escalate privileges to SYSTEM. | [1]https://kb.filewave.com/books/downloads/page/filewave-version-1603 |

| 8 | CVE-2025-32956 | 8.0  | HIGH | ManageWiki is a MediaWiki extension allowing users to manage wikis. Versions before commit f504ed8, are vulnerable to SQL injection when renaming a namespace in Special:ManageWiki/namespaces when using a page prefix (namespace name, which is the current namespace you are renaming) with an injection payload. This issue has been patched in commit f504ed8. A workaround for this vulnerability involves setting `$wgManageWiki[`namespaces`] = false;`. | [1]https://github.com/miraheze/ManageWiki/commit/f504ed8eeb59b57ebb90f93cd44f23da4c5bc4c9<br>[2]https://github.com/miraheze/ManageWiki/security/advisories/GHSA-gg42-cv66-f5x7 |
| 9 | CVE-2025-32958 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Adept is a language for general purpose programming. Prior to commit a1a41b7, the remoteBuild.yml workflow file uses actions/upload-artifact@v4 to upload the mac-standalone artifact. This artifact is a zip of the current directory, which includes the automatically generated .git/config file containing the run`s GITHUB_TOKEN. Seeing as the artifact can be downloaded prior to the end of the workflow, there is a few seconds where an attacker can extract the token from the artifact and use it with the Github API to push malicious code or rewrite release commits in the AdeptLanguage/Adept repository. This issue has been patched in commit a1a41b7. | [1]https://github.com/AdeptLanguage/Adept/commit/a1a41b72cdf1bebfc0cf6d7b3a8350e6406b2220<br>[2]https://github.com/AdeptLanguage/Adept/security/advisories/GHSA-8c7v-vccv-cx4q |
