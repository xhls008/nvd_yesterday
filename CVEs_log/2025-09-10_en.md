| 3 | CVE-2025-58755 | 8.8  | HIGH | MONAI (Medical Open Network for AI) is an AI toolkit for health care imaging. The extractall function `zip_file.extractall(output_dir)` is used directly to process compressed files. It is used in many places in the project. In versions up to and including 1.5.0, when the Zip file containing malicious content is decompressed, it overwrites the system files. In addition, the project allows the download of the zip content through the link, which increases the scope of exploitation of this vulnerability. As of time of publication, no known fixed versions are available. | [1]https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/security/advisories/GHSA-x6ww-pf9m-m73m |
| 4 | CVE-2025-58756 | 8.8  | HIGH | MONAI (Medical Open Network for AI) is an AI toolkit for health care imaging. In versions up to and including 1.5.0, in `model_dict = torch.load(full_path, map_location=torch.device(device), weights_only=True)` in monai/bundle/scripts.py , `weights_only=True` is loaded securely. However, insecure loading methods still exist elsewhere in the project, such as when loading checkpoints. This is a common practice when users want to reduce training time and costs by loading pre-trained models downloaded from other platforms. Loading a checkpoint containing malicious content can trigger a deserialization vulnerability, leading to code execution. As of time of publication, no known fixed versions are available. | [1]https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/security/advisories/GHSA-6vm5-6jv9-rjpj |
| 5 | CVE-2025-58757 | 8.8  | HIGH | MONAI (Medical Open Network for AI) is an AI toolkit for health care imaging. In versions up to and including 1.5.0, the `pickle_operations` function in `monai/data/utils.py` automatically handles dictionary key-value pairs ending with a specific suffix and deserializes them using `pickle.loads()` . This function also lacks any security measures. The deserialization may lead to code execution. As of time of publication, no known fixed versions are available. | [1]https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/security/advisories/GHSA-p8cm-mm2v-gwjm<br>[2]https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/security/advisories/GHSA-p8cm-mm2v-gwjm |

Starting in version 1.2.0 and prior to version 1.12.4, the CoreDNS etcd plugin contains a TTL confusion vulnerability where lease IDs are incorrectly used as TTL values, enabling DNS cache pinning attacks. This effectively creates a DoS condition for DNS resolution of affected services. The `TTL()` function in `plugin/etcd/etcd.go` incorrectly casts etcd lease IDs (64-bit integers) to uint32 and uses them as TTL values. Large lease IDs become very large TTLs when cast to uint32. This enables cache pinning attacks. Version 1.12.4 contains a fix for the issue. | [1]https://github.com/coredns/coredns/commit/e1768a5d272e9da649dfb8588595e5c6e4e640bf<br>[2]https://github.com/coredns/coredns/security/advisories/GHSA-93mf-426m-g6x9 |
| 126 | CVE-2025-58760 | 8.6  | HIGH | Tautulli is a Python based monitoring and tracking tool for Plex Media Server. The `/image` API endpoint in Tautulli v2.15.3 and earlier is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files from the application server`s filesystem. In Tautulli, the `/image` API endpoint is used to serve static images from the application`s data directory to users. This endpoint can be accessed without authentication, and its intended purpose is for server background images and icons within the user interface. Attackers can exfiltrate files from the application file system, including the `tautulli.db` SQLite database containing active JWT tokens, as well as the `config.ini` file which contains the hashed admin password, the JWT token secret, and the Plex Media Server token and connection details. If the password is cracked, or if a valid JWT token is present in the database, an unauthenticated attacker can escalate their privileges to obtain administrative control over the application. Version 2.16.0 contains a fix for the issue. | [1]https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli/commit/47566128e2e5dde98980d59b7a51b98173bc0b40<br>[2]https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli/security/advisories/GHSA-8g4r-8f3f-hghp |
| 127 | CVE-2025-58761 | 8.6  | HIGH | Tautulli is a Python based monitoring and tracking tool for Plex Media Server. The `real_pms_image_proxy` endpoint in Tautulli v2.15.3 and prior is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files from the application server`s filesystem. The `real_pms_image_proxy` is used to fetch an image directly from the backing Plex Media Server. The image to be fetched is specified through an `img` URL parameter, which can either be a URL or a file path. There is some validation ensuring that `img` begins with the prefix `interfaces/default/images` in order to be served from the local filesystem. However this can be bypassed by passing an `img` parameter which begins with a valid prefix, and then adjoining path traversal characters in order to reach files outside of intended directories. An attacker can exfiltrate files on the application file system, including the `tautulli.db` SQLite database containing active JWT tokens, as well as the `config.ini` file which contains the hashed admin password, the JWT token secret, and the Plex Media Server token and connection details. If the password is cracked, or if a valid JWT token is present in the database, an unauthenticated attacker can escalate their privileges to obtain administrative control over the application. Version 2.16.0 contains a fix for the issue. | [1]https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli/commit/ec77a70aafc555e1aad0d9981f719d1200c117f1<br>[2]https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli/security/advisories/GHSA-r732-m675-wj7w |
| 128 | CVE-2025-58762 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | Tautulli is a Python based monitoring and tracking tool for Plex Media Server. In Tautulli v2.15.3 and earlier, an attacker with administrative access can use the `pms_image_proxy` endpoint to write arbitrary python scripts into the application filesystem. This leads to remote code execution when combined with the `Script` notification agent. If an attacker with administrative access changes the URL of the PMS to a server they control, they can then abuse the `pms_image_proxy` to obtain a file write into the application filesystem. This can be done by making a `pms_image_proxy` request with a URL in the `img` parameter and the desired file name in the `img_format` parameter. Tautulli then uses a hash of the desired metadata together with the `img_format` in order to construct a file path. Since the attacker controls `img_format` which occupies the end of the file path, and `img_format` is not sanitised, the attacker can then use path traversal characters to specify filename of their choosing. If the specified file does not exist, Tautaulli will then attempt to fetch the image from the configured PMS. Since the attacker controls the PMS, they can return arbitrary content in response to this request, which will then be written into the specified file. An attacker can write an arbitrary python script into a location on the application file system. The attacker can then make use of the built-in `Script` notification agent to run the local script, obtaining remote code execution on the application server. Users should upgrade to version 2.16.0 to receive a patch. | [1]https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli/commit/26e6b328112eb2cf35c164f981e0718f3a3d31a7<br>[2]https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli/security/advisories/GHSA-pxhr-29gv-4j8v |

| 139 | CVE-2025-58763 | 8.0  | HIGH | Tautulli is a Python based monitoring and tracking tool for Plex Media Server. A command injection vulnerability in Tautulli v2.15.3 and prior allows attackers with administrative privileges to obtain remote code execution on the application server. This vulnerability requires the application to have been cloned from GitHub and installed manually. When Tautulli is cloned directly from GitHub and installed manually, the application manages updates and versioning through calls to the `git` command. In the code, this is performed through the `runGit` function in `versioncheck.py`. Since `shell=True` is passed to `subproces.Popen`, this call is vulnerable to subject to command injection, as shell characters within arguments will be passed to the underlying shell. A concrete location where this can be triggered is in the `checkout_git_branch` endpoint. This endpoint stores a user-supplied remote and branch name into the `GIT_REMOTE` and `GIT_BRANCH` configuration keys without sanitization. Downstream, these keys are then fetched and passed directly into `runGit` using a format string. Hence, code execution can be obtained by using `$()` interpolation in a command. Version 2.16.0 contains a fix for the issue. | [1]https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli/security/advisories/GHSA-jrm9-r57q-6cvf |
