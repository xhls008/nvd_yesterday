| 16 | CVE-2025-27615 | 8.2  | HIGH | umatiGateway is software for connecting OPC Unified Architecture servers with an MQTT broker utilizing JSON messages. The user interface may possibly be publicly accessible with umatiGateway`s provided docker-compose file. With this access, the configuration can be viewed and altered. Commit 5d81a3412bc0051754a3095d89a06d6d743f2b16 uses `127.0.0.1:8080:8080` to limit access to the local network. For those who are unable to use this proposed patch, a firewall on Port 8080 may block remote access, but the workaround may not be perfect because Docker may also bypass a firewall by its iptable based rules for port forwarding. | [1]https://github.com/umati/umatiGateway/blob/abe73096a17307327f0d6dc0ed4db1fb93464521/README.md?plain=1#L34-L35<br>[2]https://github.com/umati/umatiGateway/commit/5d81a3412bc0051754a3095d89a06d6d743f2b16<br>[3]https://github.com/umati/umatiGateway/pull/101<br>[4]https://github.com/umati/umatiGateway/security/advisories/GHSA-qf9w-x9qx-2mq7 |
| 17 | CVE-2025-27616 | 8.5  | HIGH | Vela is a Pipeline Automation (CI/CD) framework built on Linux container technology written in Golang. Prior to versions 0.25.3 and 0.26.3, by spoofing a webhook payload with a specific set of headers and body data, an attacker could transfer ownership of a repository and its repo level secrets to a separate repository. These secrets could be exfiltrated by follow up builds to the repository. Users with an enabled repository with access to repo level CI secrets in Vela are vulnerable to the exploit, and any user with access to the CI instance and the linked source control manager can perform the exploit. Versions 0.25.3 and 0.26.3 fix the issue. No known workarounds are available. | [1]https://github.com/go-vela/server/commit/257886e5a3eea518548387885894e239668584f5<br>[2]https://github.com/go-vela/server/commit/67c1892e2464dc54b8d2588815dfb7819222500b<br>[3]https://github.com/go-vela/server/releases/tag/v0.25.3<br>[4]https://github.com/go-vela/server/releases/tag/v0.26.3<br>[5]https://github.com/go-vela/server/security/advisories/GHSA-9m63-33q3-xq5x |
| 18 | CVE-2025-27610 | 7.5  | HIGH | Rack provides an interface for developing web applications in Ruby. Prior to versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12, `Rack::Static` can serve files under the specified `root:` even if `urls:` are provided, which may expose other files under the specified `root:` unexpectedly. The vulnerability occurs because `Rack::Static` does not properly sanitize user-supplied paths before serving files. Specifically, encoded path traversal sequences are not correctly validated, allowing attackers to access files outside the designated static file directory. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain access to all files under the specified `root:` directory, provided they are able to determine then path of the file. Versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12 contain a patch for the issue. Other mitigations include removing usage of `Rack::Static`, or ensuring that `root:` points at a directory path which only contains files which should be accessed publicly. It is likely that a CDN or similar static file server would also mitigate the issue. | [1]https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/50caab74fa01ee8f5dbdee7bb2782126d20c6583<br>[2]https://github.com/rack/rack/security/advisories/GHSA-7wqh-767x-r66v |
