| 1 | CVE-2024-37903 | 8.2  | HIGH | Mastodon is a self-hosted, federated microblogging platform. Starting in version 2.6.0 and prior to versions 4.1.18 and 4.2.10, by crafting specific activities, an attacker can extend the audience of a post they do not own to other Mastodon users on a target server, thus gaining access to the contents of a post not intended for them. Versions 4.1.18 and 4.2.10 contain a patch for this issue. | [1]https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/commit/a1c7aae28aecf06659c5b18cfa131b37cd1512a3<br>[2]https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/commit/d4bf22b632ea8b1174375c4966a6768ab66393b6<br>[3]https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.1.18<br>[4]https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.2.10<br>[5]https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-xjvf-fm67-4qc3 |
| 2 | CVE-2024-39321 | 7.5  | HIGH | Traefik is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. Versions prior to 2.11.6, 3.0.4, and 3.1.0-rc3 have a vulnerability that allows bypassing IP allow-lists via HTTP/3 early data requests in QUIC 0-RTT handshakes sent with spoofed IP addresses. Versions 2.11.6, 3.0.4, and 3.1.0-rc3 contain a patch for this issue.

| 3 | CVE-2024-39687 | 7.2  | HIGH | Fedify is a TypeScript library for building federated server apps powered by ActivityPub and other standards. At present, when Fedify needs to retrieve an object or activity from a remote activitypub server, it makes a HTTP request to the `@id` or other resources present within the activity it has received from the web. This activity could reference an `@id` that points to an internal IP address, allowing an attacker to send request to resources internal to the fedify server`s network. This applies to not just resolution of documents containing activities or objects, but also to media URLs as well. Specifically this is a Server Side Request Forgery attack. Users should upgrade to Fedify version 0.9.2, 0.10.1, or 0.11.1 to receive a patch for this issue. | [1]https://github.com/dahlia/fedify/commit/30f9cf4a175704a04c874f3ea88414c5f1e00b28<br>[2]https://github.com/dahlia/fedify/commit/c641e976089dd913f649889c1bfb016df04e86ba<br>[3]https://github.com/dahlia/fedify/security/advisories/GHSA-p9cg-vqcc-grcx |
| 4 | CVE-2024-34361 | 8.5  | HIGH | Pi-hole is a DNS sinkhole that protects devices from unwanted content without installing any client-side software. A vulnerability in versions prior to 5.18.3 allows an authenticated user to make internal requests to the server via the `gravity_DownloadBlocklistFromUrl()` function. Depending on some circumstances, the vulnerability could lead to remote command execution. Version 5.18.3 contains a patch for this issue. | [1]https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/commit/2c497a9a3ea099079bbcd1eb21725b0ed54b529d<br>[2]https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/security/advisories/GHSA-jg6g-rrj6-xfg6 |
| 5 | CVE-2024-39689 | 7.5  | HIGH | Certifi is a curated collection of Root Certificates for validating the trustworthiness of SSL certificates while verifying the identity of TLS hosts. Certifi starting in 2021.05.30 and prior to 2024.07.4 recognized root certificates from `GLOBALTRUST`. Certifi 2024.07.04 removes root certificates from `GLOBALTRUST` from the root store. These are in the process of being removed from Mozilla`s trust store. `GLOBALTRUST``s root certificates are being removed pursuant to an investigation which identified "long-running and unresolved compliance issues." | [1]https://github.com/certifi/python-certifi/commit/bd8153872e9c6fc98f4023df9c2deaffea2fa463<br>[2]https://github.com/certifi/python-certifi/security/advisories/GHSA-248v-346w-9cwc<br>[3]https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-security-policy/c/XpknYMPO8dI |
| 6 | CVE-2024-39696 | 8.8  | HIGH | Evmos is a decentralized Ethereum Virtual Machine chain on the Cosmos Network. Prior to version 19.0.0, a user can create a vesting account with a 3rd party account (EOA or contract) as funder. Then, this user can create an authorization for the contract.CallerAddress, this is the authorization checked in the code. But the funds are taken from the funder address provided in the message. Consequently, the user can fund a vesting account with a 3rd party account without its permission. The funder address can be any address, so this vulnerability can be used to drain all the accounts in the chain. The issue has been patched in version 19.0.0. | [1]https://github.com/evmos/evmos/commit/0a620e176617a835ac697eea494afea09185dfaf<br>[2]https://github.com/evmos/evmos/security/advisories/GHSA-q6hg-6m9x-5g9c |
