| 1 | CVE-2025-3623 | 8.1  | HIGH | The Uncanny Automator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.0.1 via deserialization of untrusted input in the automator_api_decode_message() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain allows attackers to delete arbitrary files. | [1]https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/uncanny-automator-changelog/#6-4-0-2-2025-04-18<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/uncanny-automator/trunk/src/core/lib/helpers/class-automator-recipe-helpers.php#L540<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3276577/uncanny-automator/trunk/src/core/lib/helpers/class-automator-recipe-helpers.php<br>[4]https://wordpress.org/plugins/uncanny-automator/#developers<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/00bcfd8f-9785-449a-a0ea-16e2583d684a?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2025-2875 | 7.5  | HIGH | CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere vulnerability exists that couldcause a loss of confidentiality when an unauthenticated attacker manipulates controller’s webserver URL toaccess resources. | [1]https://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_Doc_Ref=SEVD-2025-133-01&p_enDocType=Security+and+Safety+Notice&p_File_Name=SEVD-2025-133-01.pdf |
| 3 | CVE-2024-24780 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Remote Code Execution with untrusted URI of UDF vulnerability in Apache IoTDB. The attacker who has privilege to create UDF can register malicious function from untrusted URI.This issue affects Apache IoTDB: from 1.0.0 before 1.3.4.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.3.4, which fixes the issue. | [1]https://lists.apache.org/thread/xphtm98v3zsk9vlpfh481m1ry2ctxvmj<br>[2]http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/05/14/2 |

| 6 | CVE-2025-3931 | 7.8  | HIGH | A flaw was found in Yggdrasil, which acts as a system broker, allowing the processes to communicate to other children`s "worker" processes through the DBus component. Yggdrasil creates a DBus method to dispatch messages to workers. However, it misses authentication and authorization checks, allowing every system user to call it. One available Yggdrasil worker acts as a package manager with capabilities to create and enable new repositories and install or remove packages. This flaw allows an attacker with access to the system to leverage the lack of authentication on the dispatch message to force the Yggdrasil worker to install arbitrary RPM packages. This issue results in local privilege escalation, enabling the attacker to access and modify sensitive system data. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:7592<br>[2]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-3931<br>[3]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2362345 |

| 8 | CVE-2024-54780 | 8.8  | HIGH | Netgate pfSense CE (prior to 2.8.0 beta release) and corresponding Plus builds are vulnerable to command injection in the OpenVPN widget due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input to the OpenVPN management interface. An authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary OpenVPN management commands via the remipp parameter. | [1]http://netgate.com<br>[2]https://blog.brillantit.com/exploiting-pfsense-xss-command-injection-cloud-hijack/ |

| 11 | CVE-2025-24022 | 8.5  | HIGH | iTop is an web based IT Service Management tool. Prior to versions 2.7.12, 3.1.3, and 3.2.1, server code execution is possible through the frontend of iTop`s portal.

| 12 | CVE-2025-47777 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | 5ire is a cross-platform desktop artificial intelligence assistant and model context protocol client. Versions prior to 0.11.1 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting in chatbot responses due to insufficient sanitization. This, in turn, can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via unsafe Electron protocol handling and exposed Electron APIs. All users of 5ire client versions prior to patched releases, particularly those interacting with untrusted chatbots or pasting external content, are affected. Version 0.11.1 contains a patch for the issue. | [1]https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire/commit/56601e012095194a4be0d4cb6da6b5b3cb53dea8<br>[2]https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire/security/advisories/GHSA-mr8w-mmvv-6hq8<br>[3]https://positive.security/blog/url-open-rce<br>[4]https://shabarkin.notion.site/1-click-RCE-in-Electron-Applications-501c2e96e7934610979cd3c72e844a22<br>[5]https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/security<br>[6]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROFYhS9E9eU |
| 13 | CVE-2025-47781 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Rallly is an open-source scheduling and collaboration tool. Versions up to and including 3.22.1 of the application features token based authentication. When a user attempts to login to the application, they insert their email and a 6 digit code is sent to their email address to complete the authentication. A token that consists of 6 digits only presents weak entropy however and when coupled with no token brute force protection, makes it possible for an unauthenticated attacker with knowledge of a valid email address to successfully brute force the token within 15 minutes (token expiration time) and take over the account associated with the targeted email address. All users on the Rallly applications are impacted. As long as an attacker knows the user`s email address they used to register on the app, they can systematically take over any user account. For the authentication mechanism to be safe, the token would need to be assigned a complex high entropy value that cannot be bruteforced within reasonable time, and ideally rate limiting the /api/auth/callback/email endpoint to further make brute force attempts unreasonable within the 15 minutes time. As of time of publication, no patched versions are available. | [1]https://github.com/lukevella/rallly/security/advisories/GHSA-gm8g-3r3j-48hv<br>[2]https://github.com/lukevella/rallly/security/advisories/GHSA-gm8g-3r3j-48hv |
