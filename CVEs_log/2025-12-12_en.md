| 1 | CVE-2025-67511 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | Cybersecurity AI (CAI) is an open-source framework for building and deploying AI-powered offensive and defensive automation. Versions 0.5.9 and below are vulnerable to Command Injection through the run_ssh_command_with_credentials() function, which is  available to AI agents. Only password and command inputs are escaped in run_ssh_command_with_credentials to prevent shell injection; while username, host and port values are injectable. This issue does not have a fix at the time of publication. | [1]https://github.com/aliasrobotics/cai/commit/09ccb6e0baccf56c40e6cb429c698750843a999c<br>[2]https://github.com/aliasrobotics/cai/security/advisories/GHSA-4c65-9gqf-4w8h<br>[3]https://www.hacktivesecurity.com/blog/2025/12/10/cve-2025-67511-tricking-a-security-ai-agent-into-pwning-itself |
| 2 | CVE-2025-67644 | 7.3  | HIGH | LangGraph SQLite Checkpoint is an implementation of LangGraph CheckpointSaver that uses SQLite DB (both sync and async, via aiosqlite). Versions 3.0.0 and below are vulnerable to SQL injection through the checkpoint implementation. Checkpoint allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries through metadata filter keys, affecting applications that accept untrusted metadata filter keys (not just filter values) in checkpoint search operations. The _metadata_predicate() function constructs SQL queries by interpolating filter keys directly into f-strings without validation. This issue is fixed in version 3.0.1. | [1]https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/commit/297242913f8ad2143ee3e2f72e67db0911d48e2a<br>[2]https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/security/advisories/GHSA-9rwj-6rc7-p77c |
| 3 | CVE-2025-67648 | 7.1  | HIGH | Shopware is an open commerce platform. Versions 6.4.6.0 through 6.6.10.9 and 6.7.0.0 through 6.7.5.0 have a Reflected XSS vulnerability in AuthController.php. A request parameter from the login page URL is directly rendered within the Twig template of the Storefront login page without further processing or input validation. This allows direct code injection into the template via the URL parameter, waitTime, which lacks proper input validation. This issue is fixed in versions 6.6.10.10 and 6.7.5.1. | [1]https://github.com/shopware/shopware/commit/c9242c02c84595d9fa3e2adf6a264bc90a657b58<br>[2]https://github.com/shopware/shopware/security/advisories/GHSA-6w82-v552-wjw2 |
| 4 | CVE-2025-13764 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The WP CarDealer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.16. This is due to the `WP_CarDealer_User::process_register` function not restricting what user roles a user can register with. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to supply the `administrator` role during registration and gain administrator access to the site. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/boxcar-automotive-car-dealer-wordpress-theme/49741717<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/f4893d9c-e039-43df-80b9-dbe42374caed?source=cve |

| 18 | CVE-2025-14523 | 8.2  | HIGH | A flaw in libsoup’s HTTP header handling allows multiple Host: headers in a request and returns the last occurrence for server-side processing. Common front proxies often honor the first Host: header, so this mismatch can cause vhost confusion where a proxy routes a request to one backend but the backend interprets it as destined for another host. This discrepancy enables request-smuggling style attacks, cache poisoning, or bypassing host-based access controls when an attacker supplies duplicate Host headers. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-14523<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2421349 |

| 20 | CVE-2025-14265 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | In versions of ScreenConnect™ prior to 25.8, server-side validation and integrity checks within the extension subsystem could allow the installation and execution of untrusted or arbitrary extensions by authorized or administrative users. Abuse of this behavior could result in the execution of custom code on the server or unauthorized access to application configuration data. This issue affects only the ScreenConnect server component; host and guest clients are not impacted. ScreenConnect 25.8 introduces enhanced server-side configuration handling and integrity checks to ensure only trusted extensions can be installed. | [1]https://www.connectwise.com/company/trust/security-bulletins/screenconnect-2025.8-security-patch |
| 21 | CVE-2025-55310 | 7.3  | HIGH | An issue was discovered in Foxit PDF and Editor for Windows and macOS before 13.2 and 2025 before 2025.2. An attacker able to alter or replace the static HTML files used by the StartPage feature can cause the application to load malicious or compromised content upon startup. This may result in information disclosure, unauthorized data access, or other security impacts. | [1]https://www.foxit.com/support/security-bulletins.html |
| 22 | CVE-2025-55312 | 7.8  | HIGH | An issue was discovered in Foxit PDF and Editor for Windows before 13.2 and 2025 before 2025.2. When pages in a PDF are deleted via JavaScript, the application may fail to properly update internal states. Subsequent annotation management operations assume these states are valid, causing dereference of invalid or released memory. This can lead to memory corruption, application crashes, and potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. | [1]https://www.foxit.com/support/security-bulletins.html |
| 23 | CVE-2025-55313 | 7.8  | HIGH | An issue was discovered in Foxit PDF and Editor for Windows and macOS before 13.2 and 2025 before 2025.2. They allow potential arbitrary code execution when processing crafted PDF files. The vulnerability stems from insufficient handling of memory allocation failures after assigning an extremely large value to a form field`s charLimit property via JavaScript. This can result in memory corruption and may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by persuading a user to open a malicious file. | [1]https://www.foxit.com/support/security-bulletins.html |
| 24 | CVE-2025-55314 | 7.8  | HIGH | An issue was discovered in Foxit PDF and Editor for Windows and macOS before 13.2 and 2025 before 2025.2. When pages in a PDF are deleted via JavaScript, the application may fail to properly update internal states. Subsequent annotation management operations assume these states are valid, causing dereference of invalid or released memory. This can lead to memory corruption, application crashes, and potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. | [1]https://www.foxit.com/support/security-bulletins.html |
| 25 | CVE-2025-59802 | 7.5  | HIGH | Foxit PDF Editor and Reader before 2025.2.1 allow signature spoofing via OCG. When Optional Content Groups (OCG) are supported, the state property of an OCG is runtime-only and not included in the digital signature computation buffer. An attacker can leverage JavaScript or PDF triggers to dynamically change the visibility of OCG content after signing (Post-Sign), allowing the visual content of a signed PDF to be modified without invalidating the signature. This may result in a mismatch between the signed content and what the signer or verifier sees, undermining the trustworthiness of the digital signature. The fixed versions are 2025.2.1, 14.0.1, and 13.2.1. | [1]https://www.foxit.com/support/security-bulletins.html |
