| 1 | CVE-2024-7884 | 7.5  | HIGH | When a canister method is called via ic_cdk::call* , a new Future CallFuture is created  and can be awaited by the caller to get the execution result. Internally, the state of the Future is tracked and stored in a struct called CallFutureState.  A bug in the polling implementation of the CallFuture allows multiple references to be held for this internal state and not all references were dropped before the Future is resolved. Since we have unaccounted references held, a copy of the internal state ended up being persisted in the canister`s heap and thus causing a memory leak. Impact Canisters built in Rust with ic_cdk and ic_cdk_timers are affected. If these canisters call a canister method, use timers or heartbeat, they will likely leak a small amount of memory on every such operation. In the worst case, this could lead to heap memory exhaustion triggered by an attacker. Motoko based canisters are not affected by the bug.PatchesThe patch has been backported to all minor versions between >= 0.8.0, <= 0.15.0. The patched versions available are 0.8.2, 0.9.3, 0.10.1, 0.11.6, 0.12.2, 0.13.5, 0.14.1, 0.15.1 and their previous versions have been yanked. WorkaroundsThere are no known workarounds at the moment. Developers are recommended to upgrade their canister as soon as possible to the latest available patched version of ic_cdk to avoid running out of Wasm heap memory. Upgrading the canisters (without updating `ic_cdk`) also frees the leaked memory but it`s only a temporary solution. | [1]https://docs.rs/ic-cdk/latest/ic_cdk/<br>[2]https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs/pull/509<br>[3]https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec |

| 11 | CVE-2024-45173 | 8.8  | HIGH | An issue was discovered in za-internet C-MOR Video Surveillance 5.2401. Due to improper privilege management concerning sudo privileges, C-MOR is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. The Linux user www-data running the C-MOR web interface can execute some OS commands as root via Sudo without having to enter the root password. These commands, for example, include cp, chown, and chmod, which enable an attacker to modify the system`s sudoers file in order to execute all commands with root privileges. Thus, it is possible to escalate the limited privileges of the user www-data to root privileges. | [1]https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2024-027.txt<br>[2]https://www.syss.de/pentest-blog/mehrere-sicherheitsschwachstellen-in-videoueberwachungssoftware-c-mor-syss-2024-020-bis-030 |
| 12 | CVE-2024-45178 | 7.1  | HIGH | An issue was discovered in za-internet C-MOR Video Surveillance 5.2401. Due to improper user input validation, it is possible to download arbitrary files from the C-MOR system via a path traversal attack. It was found out that different functionalities are vulnerable to path traversal attacks, due to insufficient user input validation. For instance, the download functionality for backups provided by the script download-bkf.pml is vulnerable to a path traversal attack via the parameter bkf. This enables an authenticated user to download arbitrary files as Linux user www-data from the C-MOR system. Another path traversal attack is in the script show-movies.pml, which can be exploited via the parameter cam. | [1]https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2024-025.txt<br>[2]https://www.syss.de/pentest-blog/mehrere-sicherheitsschwachstellen-in-videoueberwachungssoftware-c-mor-syss-2024-020-bis-030 |
| 13 | CVE-2024-42885 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | SQL Injection vulnerability in ESAFENET CDG 5.6 and before allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code via the id parameter of the data.jsp page. | [1]https://supervisor0.notion.site/ESAFENET-CDG-SQL-Injection-17d7e244810147f697c3c42a884f932b |
| 14 | CVE-2024-45171 | 8.8  | HIGH | An issue was discovered in za-internet C-MOR Video Surveillance 5.2401. Due to improper user input validation, it is possible to upload dangerous files, for instance PHP code, to the C-MOR system. By analyzing the C-MOR web interface, it was found out that the upload functionality for backup files allows an authenticated user to upload arbitrary files. The only condition is that the filename contains a .cbkf string. Therefore, webshell.cbkf.php is considered a valid file name for the C-MOR web application. Uploaded files are stored within the directory "/srv/www/backups" on the C-MOR system, and can thus be accessed via the URL https://<HOST>/backup/upload_<FILENAME>. Due to broken access control, low-privileged authenticated users can also use this file upload functionality. | [1]https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2024-026.txt<br>[2]https://www.syss.de/pentest-blog/mehrere-sicherheitsschwachstellen-in-videoueberwachungssoftware-c-mor-syss-2024-020-bis-030 |
| 15 | CVE-2024-45175 | 8.8  | HIGH | An issue was discovered in za-internet C-MOR Video Surveillance 5.2401. Sensitive information is stored in cleartext. It was found out that sensitive information, for example login credentials of cameras, is stored in cleartext. Thus, an attacker with filesystem access, for example exploiting a path traversal attack, has access to the login data of all configured cameras, or the configured FTP server. | [1]https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2024-028.txt<br>[2]https://www.syss.de/pentest-blog/mehrere-sicherheitsschwachstellen-in-videoueberwachungssoftware-c-mor-syss-2024-020-bis-030 |

| 20 | CVE-2024-45401 | 7.5  | HIGH | stripe-cli is a command-line tool for the payment processor Stripe. A vulnerability exists in stripe-cli starting in version 1.11.1 and prior to version 1.21.3 where a plugin package containing a manifest with a malformed plugin shortname installed using the --archive-url or --archive-path flags can overwrite arbitrary files. The update in version 1.21.3 addresses the path traversal vulnerability by removing the ability to install plugins from an archive URL or path.

| 23 | CVE-2024-8247 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Newsletters plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 4.9.9.2. This is due to the plugin not restricting what user meta can be updated as screen options. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to escalate their privileges to that of an administrator. Please note that this only affects users with access to edit/update screen options, which means an administrator would need to grant lower privilege users with access to the Sent & Draft Emails page of the plugin in order for this to be exploited. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/newsletters-lite/tags/4.9.9.1/wp-mailinglist.php#L3279<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3146287%40newsletters-lite&new=3146287%40newsletters-lite&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/2577102f-6355-4483-bd3d-1948497cb843?source=cve |

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3139798/lifterlms/tags/7.7.6/includes/abstracts/abstract.llms.database.query.php<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/3a096506-b18e-419c-808b-6099baa628ce?source=cve |
