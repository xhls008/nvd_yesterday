| 1 | CVE-2025-6758 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Real Spaces - WordPress Properties Directory Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via the `imic_agent_register` function in all versions up to, and including, 3.6. This is due to a lack of restriction in the registration role. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to arbitrarily choose their role, including the Administrator role, during user registration. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/real-spaces-wordpress-real-estate-theme/8219779<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e2b24858-dfcd-46f3-9552-c7acc63a1ee7?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2025-8218 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Real Spaces - WordPress Properties Directory Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via the `change_role_member` parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.5. This is due to a lack of restriction in the profile update role. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to arbitrarily choose their role, including the Administrator role, during a profile update. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/real-spaces-wordpress-real-estate-theme/8219779<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/2d07880b-9af1-4b1e-aa70-b95ef10a6e33?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2025-7670 | 7.5  | HIGH | The JS Archive List plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the build_sql_where() function in all versions up to, and including, 6.1.5 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://github.com/Skatox/jquery-archive-list/commit/1c4a5749b187cc65d2c4b192b9c9890a36bf1fd2<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/jquery-archive-list-widget/tags/6.1.5/classes/class-jq-archive-list-datasource.php<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3341291/<br>[4]https://wordpress.org/plugins/jquery-archive-list-widget/#developers<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/72857d52-ac81-4eb2-93fa-7bb03265bccf?source=cve |

| 8 | CVE-2025-54336 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | In Plesk Obsidian 18.0.70, _isAdminPasswordValid uses an == comparison. Thus, if the correct password is "0e" followed by any digit string, then an attacker can login with any other string that evaluates to 0.0 (such as the 0e0 string). This occurs in admin/plib/LoginManager.php. | [1]https://support.plesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/33785727869847-Vulnerability-CVE-2025-54336<br>[2]https://www.plesk.com/blog/plesk-news-announcements/introducing-plesk-obsidian-18-0-70-anniversary-edition/ |
| 9 | CVE-2025-52478 | 8.7  | HIGH | n8n is a workflow automation platform. From 1.77.0 to before 1.98.2, a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in n8n, specifically in the Form Trigger node`s HTML form element. An authenticated attacker can inject malicious HTML via an <iframe> with a srcdoc payload that includes arbitrary JavaScript execution. The attacker can also inject malicious Javascript by using <video> coupled <source> using an onerror event. While using iframe or a combination of video and source tag, this vulnerability allows for Account Takeover (ATO) by exfiltrating n8n-browserId and session cookies from authenticated users who visit a maliciously crafted form. Using these tokens and cookies, an attacker can impersonate the victim and change account details such as email addresses, enabling full control over the account—especially if 2FA is not enabled. Users should upgrade to version >= 1.98.2. | [1]https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/commit/7940384a85041a1890b1203d69c092c887312500<br>[2]https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/16329<br>[3]https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/security/advisories/GHSA-hfmv-hhh3-43f2 |
| 10 | CVE-2025-55294 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | screenshot-desktop allows capturing a screenshot of your local machine. This vulnerability is a command injection issue. When user-controlled input is passed into the format option of the screenshot function, it is interpolated into a shell command without sanitization. This results in arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the calling process. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.15.2. | [1]https://github.com/bencevans/screenshot-desktop/commit/59c87b0c175eec76090e6ccde313f4fc5d569b78<br>[2]https://github.com/bencevans/screenshot-desktop/security/advisories/GHSA-gjx4-2c7g-fm94 |

| 15 | CVE-2025-55733 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | DeepChat is a smart assistant that connects powerful AI to your personal world.  DeepChat before 0.3.1 has a one-click remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by embedding a specially crafted deepchat: URL on any website, including a malicious one they control. When a victim visits such a site or clicks on the link, the browser triggers the app’s custom URL handler (deepchat:), causing the DeepChat application to launch and process the URL, leading to remote code execution on the victim’s machine. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.3.1. | [1]https://github.com/ThinkInAIXYZ/deepchat/commit/a0ff6f362e01ddceb7fd42d0af0b28b6184fb4d2<br>[2]https://github.com/ThinkInAIXYZ/deepchat/security/advisories/GHSA-hqr4-4gfc-5p2j<br>[3]https://github.com/ThinkInAIXYZ/deepchat/security/advisories/GHSA-hqr4-4gfc-5p2j |
