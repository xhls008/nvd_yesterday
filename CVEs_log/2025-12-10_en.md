This issue potentially leads to memory corruption, information disclosure, or code execution. This issue is fixed in versions 0.41.2, 0.47.1, 0.51.3 and 1.0.1. To workaround this issue, consider limiting the maximum linear memory sizes where feasible. | [1]https://github.com/wasmi-labs/wasmi/security/advisories/GHSA-g4v2-cjqp-rfmq |

Versions prior to 3.0-20251107.114628 contain the APIs /iaf/ladybug/api/report/{storage} and /iaf/ladybug/api/report/upload, which allow uploading gzip-compressed XML files with user-controllable content. The system deserializes these XML files, enabling attackers to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by submitting carefully crafted XML payloads and thereby gain access to the target server. This issue is fixed in version 3.0-20251107.114628. | [1]https://github.com/wearefrank/ladybug/security/advisories/GHSA-f9fh-r3cv-398f<br>[2]https://github.com/wearefrank/ladybug/security/advisories/GHSA-f9fh-r3cv-398f |
| 125 | CVE-2025-64785 | 7.8  | HIGH | Acrobat Reader versions 24.001.30264, 20.005.30793, 25.001.20982, 24.001.30273, 20.005.30803 and earlier are affected by an Untrusted Search Path vulnerability that might allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the application uses a search path to locate critical resources such as programs, an attacker could modify that search path to point to a malicious program, which the targeted application would then execute. Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction. | [1]https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb25-119.html |
| 126 | CVE-2025-64899 | 7.8  | HIGH | Acrobat Reader versions 24.001.30264, 20.005.30793, 25.001.20982, 24.001.30273, 20.005.30803 and earlier are affected by an out-of-bounds read vulnerability when parsing a crafted file, which could result in a read past the end of an allocated memory structure. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must open a malicious file. | [1]https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb25-119.html |
| 127 | CVE-2025-66626 | 8.1  | HIGH | Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. Versions 3.6.13 and below and versions 3.7.0 through 3.7.4, contain unsafe untar code that handles symbolic links in archives. Concretely, the computation of a link`s target and the subsequent check are flawed. An attacker can overwrite the file /var/run/argo/argoexec with a script of their choice, which would be executed at the pod`s start. The patch deployed against CVE-2025-62156 is ineffective against malicious archives containing symbolic links. This issue is fixed in versions 3.6.14 and 3.7.5. | [1]https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p84v-gxvw-73pf<br>[2]https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/5291e0b01f94ba864f96f795bb500f2cfc5ad799/workflow/executor/executor.go#L1034-L1037<br>[3]https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/commit/6b92af23f35aed4d4de8b04adcaf19d68f006de1<br>[4]https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/security/advisories/GHSA-xrqc-7xgx-c9vh |
| 128 | CVE-2025-67488 | 7.8  | HIGH | SiYuan is self-hosted, open source personal knowledge management software. Versions 0.0.0-20251202123337-6ef83b42c7ce and below contain function importZipMd which is vulnerable to ZipSlips, allowing an authenticated user to overwrite files on the system. An authenticated user with access to the import functionality in notes is able to overwrite any file on the system, and can escalate to full code execution under some circumstances. A fix is planned for version 3.5.0. | [1]https://github.com/siyuan-note/siyuan/blob/dae6158860cc704e353454565c96e874278c6f47/kernel/api/import.go#L190<br>[2]https://github.com/siyuan-note/siyuan/security/advisories/GHSA-gqfv-g4v7-m366 |
| 129 | CVE-2025-67489 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | @vitejs/plugin-rs provides React Server Components (RSC) support for Vite. Versions 0.5.5 and below are vulnerable to arbitrary remote code execution on the development server through unsafe dynamic imports in server function APIs (loadServerAction, decodeReply, decodeAction) when integrated into RSC applications that expose server function endpoints. Attackers with network access to the development server can read/modify files, exfiltrate sensitive data (source code, environment variables, credentials), or pivot to other internal services. While this affects development servers only, the risk increases when using vite --host to expose the server on all network interfaces. This issue is fixed in version 0.5.6. | [1]https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/commit/fe634b58210d0a4a146a7faae56cd71af3bb9af4<br>[2]https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/security/advisories/GHSA-j76j-5p5g-9wfr |
| 130 | CVE-2025-66645 | 7.5  | HIGH | NiceGUI is a Python-based UI framework. Versions 3.3.1 and below are vulnerable to  directory traversal through the App.add_media_files() function, which allows a remote attacker to read arbitrary files on the server filesystem. This issue is fixed in version 3.4.0. | [1]https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/commit/a1b89e2a24e1911a40389ace2153a37f4eea92a9<br>[2]https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/security/advisories/GHSA-hxp3-63hc-5366 |
| 131 | CVE-2025-67494 | 9.3  | CRITICAL | ZITADEL is an open-source identity infrastructure tool. Versions 4.7.0 and below are vulnerable to an unauthenticated, full-read SSRF vulnerability. The ZITADEL Login UI (V2) treats the x-zitadel-forward-host header as a trusted fallback for all deployments, including self-hosted instances. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to force the server to make HTTP requests to arbitrary domains, such as internal addresses, and read the responses, enabling data exfiltration and bypassing network-segmentation controls. This issue is fixed in version 4.7.1. | [1]https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/commit/4c879b47334e01d4fcab921ac1b44eda39acdb96<br>[2]https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/security/advisories/GHSA-7wfc-4796-gmg5 |
| 132 | CVE-2025-67495 | 8.0  | HIGH | ZITADEL is an open-source identity infrastructure tool. Versions 4.0.0-rc.1 through 4.7.0 are vulnerable to DOM-Based XSS through the Zitadel V2 logout endpoint. The /logout endpoint insecurely routes to a value that is supplied in the post_logout_redirect GET parameter. As a result, unauthenticated remote attacker can execute malicious JS code on Zitadel users’ browsers. To carry out an attack, multiple user sessions need to be active in the same browser, however, account takeover is mitigated  when using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Passwordless authentication. This issue is fixed in version 4.7.1. | [1]https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/commit/4c879b47334e01d4fcab921ac1b44eda39acdb96<br>[2]https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/security/advisories/GHSA-v959-qxv6-6f8p |
