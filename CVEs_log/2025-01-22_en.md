| 1 | CVE-2024-10936 | 8.8  | HIGH | The String locator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.6 via deserialization of untrusted input in the `recursive_unserialize_replace` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. An administrator must perform a search and replace action to trigger the exploit. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/string-locator/trunk/includes/Extension/SearchReplace/Replace/class-sql.php#L170<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3222952/<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/1404f034-2d1d-44b2-87e5-61f72f215417?source=cve |

| 33 | CVE-2025-24017 | 7.6  | HIGH | YesWiki is a wiki system written in PHP. Versions up to and including 4.4.5 are vulnerable to any end-user crafting a DOM based XSS on all of YesWiki`s pages which is triggered when a user clicks on a malicious link. The vulnerability makes use of the search by tag feature. When a tag doesn`t exist, the tag is reflected on the page and isn`t properly sanitized on the server side which allows a malicious user to generate a link that will trigger an XSS on the client`s side when clicked. This vulnerability allows any user to generate a malicious link that will trigger an account takeover when clicked, therefore allowing a user to steal other accounts, modify pages, comments, permissions, extract user data (emails), thus impacting the integrity, availability and confidentiality of a YesWiki instance. Version 4.5.0 contains a patch for the issue. | [1]https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/commit/c1e28b59394957902c31c850219e4504a20db98b<br>[2]https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/security/advisories/GHSA-wphc-5f2j-jhvg |
| 34 | CVE-2025-24018 | 7.6  | HIGH | YesWiki is a wiki system written in PHP. In versions up to and including 4.4.5, it is possible for an authenticated user with rights to edit/create a page or comment to trigger a stored XSS which will be reflected on any page where the resource is loaded. The vulnerability makes use of the content edition feature and more specifically of the `{{attach}}` component allowing users to attach files/medias to a page. When a file is attached using the `{{attach}}` component, if the resource contained in the `file` attribute doesn`t exist, then the server will generate a file upload button containing the filename. This vulnerability allows any malicious authenticated user that has the right to create a comment or edit a page to be able to steal accounts and therefore modify pages, comments, permissions, extract user data (emails), thus impacting the integrity, availability and confidentiality of a YesWiki instance. Version 4.5.0 contains a patch for the issue. | [1]https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/blob/v4.4.5/tools/attach/libs/attach.lib.php#L660<br>[2]https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/commit/c1e28b59394957902c31c850219e4504a20db98b<br>[3]https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/security/advisories/GHSA-w59h-3x3q-3p6j<br>[4]https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/security/advisories/GHSA-w59h-3x3q-3p6j |

| 43 | CVE-2025-24019 | 7.1  | HIGH | YesWiki is a wiki system written in PHP. In versions up to and including 4.4.5, it is possible for any authenticated user, through the use of the filemanager to delete any file owned by the user running the FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) on the host without any limitation on the filesystem`s scope. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user to arbitrarily remove content from the Wiki resulting in partial loss of data and defacement/deterioration of the website. In the context of a container installation of YesWiki without any modification, the `yeswiki` files (for example .php) are not owned by the same user (root) as the one running the FPM process (www-data). However in a standard installation, www-data may also be the owner of the PHP files, allowing a malicious user to completely cut the access to the wiki by deleting all important PHP files (like index.php or core files of YesWiki). Version 4.5.0 contains a patch for this issue. | [1]https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/commit/3ddd833d22703caf9025659eb174f7765df7147c<br>[2]https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/security/advisories/GHSA-43c9-gw4x-pcx6 |
