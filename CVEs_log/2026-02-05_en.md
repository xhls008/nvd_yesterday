| 20 | CVE-2026-25121 | 7.5  | HIGH | apko allows users to build and publish OCI container images built from apk packages. From version 0.14.8 to before 1.1.1, a path traversal vulnerability was discovered in apko`s dirFS filesystem abstraction. An attacker who can supply a malicious APK package (e.g., via a compromised or typosquatted repository) could create directories or symlinks outside the intended installation root. The MkdirAll, Mkdir, and Symlink methods in pkg/apk/fs/rwosfs.go use filepath.Join() without validating that the resulting path stays within the base directory. This issue has been patched in version 1.1.1. | [1]https://github.com/chainguard-dev/apko/commit/d8b7887a968a527791b3c591ae83928cb49a9f14<br>[2]https://github.com/chainguard-dev/apko/security/advisories/GHSA-5g94-c2wx-8pxw |
| 21 | CVE-2026-25140 | 7.5  | HIGH | apko allows users to build and publish OCI container images built from apk packages. From version 0.14.8 to before 1.1.1, an attacker who controls or compromises an APK repository used by apko could cause resource exhaustion on the build host. The ExpandApk function in pkg/apk/expandapk/expandapk.go expands .apk streams without enforcing decompression limits, allowing a malicious repository to serve a small, highly-compressed .apk that inflates into a large tar stream, consuming excessive disk space and CPU time, causing build failures or denial of service. This issue has been patched in version 1.1.1. | [1]https://github.com/chainguard-dev/apko/commit/2be3903fe194ad46351840f0569b35f5ac965f09<br>[2]https://github.com/chainguard-dev/apko/security/advisories/GHSA-f4w5-5xv9-85f6 |

This issue does not affect users that use @apollo/server as a dependency for integration packages, like @as-integrations/express5 or @as-integrations/next, only direct usage of startStandaloneServer. | [1]https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/d25a5bdc377826ad424fcf7f8d1d062055911643<br>[2]https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/e9d49d163a86b8a33be56ed27c494b9acd5400a4<br>[3]https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/security/advisories/GHSA-mp6q-xf9x-fwf7 |
| 23 | CVE-2026-24843 | 8.2  | HIGH | melange allows users to build apk packages using declarative pipelines. In version 0.11.3 to before 0.40.3, an attacker who can influence the tar stream from a QEMU guest VM could write files outside the intended workspace directory on the host. The retrieveWorkspace function extracts tar entries without validating that paths stay within the workspace, allowing path traversal via ../ sequences. This issue has been patched in version 0.40.3. | [1]https://github.com/chainguard-dev/melange/commit/6e243d0d46699f837d7c392397a694d2bcc7612b<br>[2]https://github.com/chainguard-dev/melange/security/advisories/GHSA-qxx2-7h4c-83f4 |
| 24 | CVE-2026-24844 | 7.9  | HIGH | melange allows users to build apk packages using declarative pipelines. From version 0.3.0 to before 0.40.3, an attacker who can provide build input values, but not modify pipeline definitions, could execute arbitrary shell commands if the pipeline uses ${{vars.*}} or ${{inputs.*}} substitutions in working-directory. The field is embedded into shell scripts without proper quote escaping. This issue has been patched in version 0.40.3. | [1]https://github.com/chainguard-dev/melange/commit/e51ca30cfb63178f5a86997d23d3fff0359fa6c8<br>[2]https://github.com/chainguard-dev/melange/security/advisories/GHSA-vqqr-rmpc-hhg2 |
| 25 | CVE-2026-24884 | 8.4  | HIGH | Compressing is a compressing and uncompressing lib for node. In version 2.0.0 and 1.10.3 and prior, Compressing extracts TAR archives while restoring symbolic links without validating their targets. By embedding symlinks that resolve outside the intended extraction directory, an attacker can cause subsequent file entries to be written to arbitrary locations on the host file system. Depending on the extractor’s handling of existing files, this behavior may allow overwriting sensitive files or creating new files in security-critical locations. This issue has been patched in versions 1.10.4 and 2.0.1. | [1]https://github.com/node-modules/compressing/commit/8d16c196c7f1888fc1af957d9ff36117247cea6c<br>[2]https://github.com/node-modules/compressing/commit/ce1c0131c401c071c77d5a1425bf8c88cfc16361<br>[3]https://github.com/node-modules/compressing/security/advisories/GHSA-cc8f-xg8v-72m3 |
| 26 | CVE-2026-25143 | 7.8  | HIGH | melange allows users to build apk packages using declarative pipelines. From version 0.10.0 to before 0.40.3, an attacker who can influence inputs to the patch pipeline could execute arbitrary shell commands on the build host. The patch pipeline in pkg/build/pipelines/patch.yaml embeds input-derived values (series paths, patch filenames, and numeric parameters) into shell scripts without proper quoting or validation, allowing shell metacharacters to break out of their intended context. The vulnerability affects the built-in patch pipeline which can be invoked through melange build and melange license-check operations. An attacker who can control patch-related inputs (e.g., through pull request-driven CI, build-as-a-service, or by influencing melange configurations) can inject shell metacharacters such as backticks, command substitutions $(…), semicolons, pipes, or redirections to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the melange build process. This issue has been patched in version 0.40.3. | [1]https://github.com/chainguard-dev/melange/commit/bd132535cd9f57d4bd39d9ead0633598941af030<br>[2]https://github.com/chainguard-dev/melange/security/advisories/GHSA-rf4g-89h5-crcr |
| 27 | CVE-2026-25157 | 7.7  | HIGH | OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to version 2026.1.29, there is an OS command injection vulnerability via the Project Root Path in sshNodeCommand. The sshNodeCommand function constructed a shell script without properly escaping the user-supplied project path in an error message. When the cd command failed, the unescaped path was interpolated directly into an echo statement, allowing arbitrary command execution on the remote SSH host. The parseSSHTarget function did not validate that SSH target strings could not begin with a dash. An attacker-supplied target like -oProxyCommand=... would be interpreted as an SSH configuration flag rather than a hostname, allowing arbitrary command execution on the local machine. This issue has been patched in version 2026.1.29. | [1]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-q284-4pvr-m585 |

| 37 | CVE-2026-25546 | 7.8  | HIGH | Godot MCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with the Godot game engine. Prior to version 0.1.1, a command injection vulnerability in godot-mcp allows remote code execution. The executeOperation function passed user-controlled input (e.g., projectPath) directly to exec(), which spawns a shell. An attacker could inject shell metacharacters like $(command) or &calc to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the MCP server process. This affects any tool that accepts projectPath, including create_scene, add_node, load_sprite, and others. This issue has been patched in version 0.1.1. | [1]https://github.com/Coding-Solo/godot-mcp/commit/21c785d923cfdb471ea60323c13807d62dfecc5a<br>[2]https://github.com/Coding-Solo/godot-mcp/issues/64<br>[3]https://github.com/Coding-Solo/godot-mcp/pull/67<br>[4]https://github.com/Coding-Solo/godot-mcp/security/advisories/GHSA-8jx2-rhfh-q928 |
| 38 | CVE-2026-25582 | 7.8  | HIGH | iccDEV provides a set of libraries and tools that allow for the interaction, manipulation, and application of ICC color management profiles. Prior to version 2.3.1.3, there is a heap buffer overflow (read) vulnerability in CIccIO::WriteUInt16Float() when converting malformed XML to ICC profiles via iccFromXml tool.

| 40 | CVE-2026-25584 | 7.8  | HIGH | iccDEV provides a set of libraries and tools that allow for the interaction, manipulation, and application of ICC color management profiles. Prior to version 2.3.1.3, there is a stack-buffer-overflow vulnerability in CIccTagFloatNum<>::GetValues(). This is triggered when processing a malformed ICC profile. The vulnerability allows an out-of-bounds write on the stack, potentially leading to memory corruption, information disclosure, or code execution when processing specially crafted ICC files. This issue has been patched in version 2.3.1.3. | [1]https://github.com/InternationalColorConsortium/iccDEV/commit/c9cb108f58683bd87afca616dea3e4cdb884c23f<br>[2]https://github.com/InternationalColorConsortium/iccDEV/issues/551<br>[3]https://github.com/InternationalColorConsortium/iccDEV/pull/565<br>[4]https://github.com/InternationalColorConsortium/iccDEV/security/advisories/GHSA-xjr3-v3vr-5794 |
| 41 | CVE-2026-22038 | 8.1  | HIGH | AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. Prior to autogpt-platform-beta-v0.6.46, the AutoGPT platform`s Stagehand integration blocks log API keys and authentication secrets in plaintext using logger.info() statements. This occurs in three separate block implementations (StagehandObserveBlock, StagehandActBlock, and StagehandExtractBlock) where the code explicitly calls api_key.get_secret_value() and logs the result. This issue has been patched in autogpt-platform-beta-v0.6.46. | [1]https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/commit/1eabc604842fa876c09d69af43d2d1e8fb9b8eb9<br>[2]https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/security/advisories/GHSA-rc89-6g7g-v5v7 |
| 42 | CVE-2026-25585 | 7.8  | HIGH | iccDEV provides a set of libraries and tools that allow for the interaction, manipulation, and application of ICC color management profiles. Prior to version 2.3.1.3, there is a vulnerability IccCmm.cpp:5793 when reading through index during ICC profile processing. The malformed ICC profile triggers improper array bounds validation in the color management module, resulting in an out-of-bounds read that can lead to memory disclosure or segmentation fault from accessing memory beyond the array boundary. This issue has been patched in version 2.3.1.3. | [1]https://github.com/InternationalColorConsortium/iccDEV/commit/ba81cd94b9c82b1d3905d45427badbd9d8adfa15<br>[2]https://github.com/InternationalColorConsortium/iccDEV/issues/552<br>[3]https://github.com/InternationalColorConsortium/iccDEV/pull/563<br>[4]https://github.com/InternationalColorConsortium/iccDEV/security/advisories/GHSA-pmqx-q624-jg6w |
