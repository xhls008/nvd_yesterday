| 1 | CVE-2025-12510 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Widgets for Google Reviews plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 13.2.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on Google Reviews data imported by the plugin. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that will execute in the admin panel (and potentially on the frontend) whenever a user accesses imported reviews, granted they can add a malicious review to a Google Place that is connected to the vulnerable site. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-reviews-plugin-for-google/tags/13.2.1/trustindex-plugin.class.php#L5907<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-reviews-plugin-for-google/tags/13.2.1/trustindex-plugin.class.php#L5932<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3399469/wp-reviews-plugin-for-google/trunk/trustindex-plugin.class.php?old=3398822&old_path=wp-reviews-plugin-for-google%2Ftrunk%2Ftrustindex-plugin.class.php<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/7adf3335-ed13-43f4-a5f3-05e89be44d2d?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2025-12673 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Flex QR Code Generator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the update_qr_code() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://github.com/d0n601/CVE-2025-12673<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/flex-qr-code-generator/trunk/qr-code-generator.php#L457<br>[3]https://ryankozak.com/posts/cve-2025-12673/<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/3d71404e-0db8-485b-a626-5e0df2076c05?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2025-13377 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | The 10Web Booster – Website speed optimization, Cache & Page Speed optimizer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary folder deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the get_cache_dir_for_page_from_url() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.32.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary folders on the server, which can easily lead to a loss of data or a denial of service condition. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3402434/tenweb-speed-optimizer<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/f8bcf51a-36ee-4d4d-b9d6-d9db0dafd791?source=cve |

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. NOTE: This vulnerability was partially patched in version 6.6.2. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3389203/widget-google-reviews<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3411521/widget-google-reviews<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e2960224-4446-4fc6-8d18-6f9911b4cbad?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2025-12966 | 8.8  | HIGH | The All-in-One Video Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the resolve_import_directory() function in versions 4.5.4 to 4.5.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3405593/all-in-one-video-gallery/trunk/admin/import-export.php<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0b03bca1-84e3-4220-b39b-69044c42e9f9?source=cve |
| 6 | CVE-2025-13065 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Starter Templates plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file upload in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.41. This is due to insufficient file type validation detecting WXR files, allowing double extension files to bypass sanitization while being accepted as a valid WXR file. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3395498/astra-sites/tags/4.4.42/inc/lib/starter-templates-importer/importer/wxr-importer/st-wxr-importer.php<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/439e4c99-8f34-4e66-9d86-c0cbb8cf6da0?source=cve |
