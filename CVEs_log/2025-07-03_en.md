| 1 | CVE-2025-36630 | 8.4  | HIGH | In Tenable Nessus versions prior to 10.8.5 on a Windows host, it was found that a non-administrative user could overwrite arbitrary local system files with log content at SYSTEM privilege. | [1]https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2025-13 |
| 2 | CVE-2025-5692 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Lead Form Data Collection to CRM plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the doFieldAjaxAction() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site. Other AJAX actions handling plugin settings are also insufficiently protected and exploitable. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-leads-builder-any-crm/trunk/includes/Functions.php#L423<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3319750%40wp-leads-builder-any-crm&new=3319750%40wp-leads-builder-any-crm&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[3]https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-leads-builder-any-crm/<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/26404b5c-a0f2-4223-be61-1f03873666fb?source=cve |

| 16 | CVE-2025-24332 | 7.1  | HIGH | Nokia Single RAN AirScale baseband allows an authenticated administrative user access to all physical boards after performing a single login to the baseband system board. The baseband does not re-authenticate the user when they connect from the baseband system board to the baseband capacity boards using the internal bsoc SSH service, which is available only internally within the baseband and through the internal backplane between the boards. The bsoc SSH allows login from one board to another via the baseband internal backplane using an SSH private key present on the baseband system board.This bsoc SSH capability was previously considered an administrative functionality but has now been restricted to be available only to baseband root-privileged administrators. This restriction mitigates the possibility of misuse with lower-level privileges (e.g., from baseband software images). This mitigation is included starting from release 23R4-SR 3.0 MP and later | [1]https://www.nokia.com/about-us/security-and-privacy/product-security-advisory/cve-2025-24332/ |
| 17 | CVE-2025-27021 | 7.0  | HIGH | The misconfiguration in the sudoers configuration of the operating system in Infinera G42 version R6.1.3 allows low privileged OS users to read/write physical memory via devmem command line tool. This could allow sensitive information disclosure, denial of service, and privilege escalation by tampering with kernel memory.Details: The output of "sudo -l" reports the presence of "devmem" command executable as super user without using a password. This command allows to read and write an arbitrary memory area of the target device, specifying an absolute address. | [1]https://euvd.enisa.europa.eu/vulnerability/CVE-2025-27021<br>[2]https://www.cvcn.gov.it/cvcn/cve/CVE-2025-27021 |
