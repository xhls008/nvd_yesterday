| 1 | CVE-2025-42950 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | SAP Landscape Transformation (SLT) allows an attacker with user privileges to exploit a vulnerability in the function module exposed via RFC. This flaw enables the injection of arbitrary ABAP code into the system, bypassing essential authorization checks. This vulnerability effectively functions as a backdoor, creating the risk of full system compromise, undermining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system. | [1]https://me.sap.com/notes/3633838<br>[2]https://url.sap/sapsecuritypatchday |
| 2 | CVE-2025-42951 | 8.8  | HIGH | Due to broken authorization, SAP Business One (SLD) allows an authenticated attacker to gain administrator privileges of a database by invoking the corresponding API.�As a result , it has a high impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application. | [1]https://me.sap.com/notes/3625403<br>[2]https://url.sap/sapsecuritypatchday |
| 3 | CVE-2025-42957 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | SAP S/4HANA allows an attacker with user privileges to exploit a vulnerability in the function module exposed via RFC.
