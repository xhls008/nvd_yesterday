| 1 | CVE-2024-28964 | 7.8  | HIGH | Dell Common Event Enabler, version 8.9.10.0 and prior, contain an insecure deserialization vulnerability in CAVATools. A local unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to arbitrary code execution in the context of the logged in user. Exploitation of this issue requires a victim to open a malicious file. | [1]https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000224987/dsa-2024-179-security-update-for-dell-emc-common-event-enabler-windows-for-cavatools-vulnerabilities |
| 2 | CVE-2024-34065 | 7.1  | HIGH | Strapi is an open-source content management system. By combining two vulnerabilities (an `Open Redirect` and `session token sent as URL query parameter`) in @strapi/plugin-users-permissions before version 4.24.2, is its possible of an unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms and retrieve the 3rd party tokens. The attack requires user interaction (one click). Unauthenticated attackers can leverage two vulnerabilities to obtain an 3rd party token and the bypass authentication of Strapi apps. Users should upgrade @strapi/plugin-users-permissions to version 4.24.2 to receive a patch. | [1]https://github.com/strapi/strapi/security/advisories/GHSA-wrvh-rcmr-9qfc |
| 3 | CVE-2024-5894 | 7.3  | HIGH | A vulnerability classified as critical was found in SourceCodester Online Eyewear Shop 1.0. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file manage_product.php. The manipulation of the argument id leads to sql injection. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. VDB-268138 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/Hefei-Coffee/cve/blob/main/sql10.md<br>[2]https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.268138<br>[3]https://vuldb.com/?id.268138<br>[4]https://vuldb.com/?submit.354912 |
| 4 | CVE-2024-37300 | 8.1  | HIGH | OAuthenticator is software that allows OAuth2 identity providers to be plugged in and used with JupyterHub. JupyterHub < 5.0, when used with `GlobusOAuthenticator`, could be configured to allow all users from a particular institution only. This worked fine prior to JupyterHub 5.0, because `allow_all` did not take precedence over `identity_provider`. Since JupyterHub 5.0, `allow_all` does take precedence over `identity_provider`. On a hub with the same config, now all users will be allowed to login, regardless of `identity_provider`. `identity_provider` will basically be ignored. This is a documented change in JupyterHub 5.0, but is likely to catch many users by surprise. OAuthenticator 16.3.1 fixes the issue with JupyterHub 5.0, and does not affect previous versions. As a workaround, do not upgrade to JupyterHub 5.0 when using `GlobusOAuthenticator` in the prior configuration. | [1]https://github.com/jupyterhub/oauthenticator/commit/d1aea05fa89f2beae15ab0fa0b0d071030f79654<br>[2]https://github.com/jupyterhub/oauthenticator/security/advisories/GHSA-gprj-3p75-f996<br>[3]https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/howto/upgrading-v5.html#authenticator-allow-all-and-allow-existing-users |
| 5 | CVE-2024-5896 | 7.3  | HIGH | A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in SourceCodester Employee and Visitor Gate Pass Logging System 1.0. Affected is the function save_users of the file /classes/Users.php?f=save. The manipulation of the argument id leads to sql injection. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-268140. | [1]https://github.com/Hefei-Coffee/cve/blob/main/sql12.md<br>[2]https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.268140<br>[3]https://vuldb.com/?id.268140<br>[4]https://vuldb.com/?submit.354925 |
