| 1 | CVE-2024-5543 | 8.1  | HIGH | The Slideshow Gallery LITE plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the id parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.1 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/slideshow-gallery/trunk/slideshow-gallery.php#L620<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3100785%40slideshow-gallery%2Ftrunk&old=3098970%40slideshow-gallery%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/5edd72d9-3086-4f4f-ae5b-830c8621b83a?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2024-5154 | 8.1  | HIGH | A flaw was found in cri-o. A malicious container can create a symbolic link pointing to an arbitrary directory or file on the host via directory traversal (“../“).

| 7 | CVE-2024-28964 | 7.8  | HIGH | Dell Common Event Enabler, version 8.9.10.0 and prior, contain an insecure deserialization vulnerability in CAVATools. A local unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to arbitrary code execution in the context of the logged in user. Exploitation of this issue requires a victim to open a malicious file. | [1]https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000224987/dsa-2024-179-security-update-for-dell-emc-common-event-enabler-windows-for-cavatools-vulnerabilities |
| 8 | CVE-2024-34065 | 7.1  | HIGH | Strapi is an open-source content management system. By combining two vulnerabilities (an `Open Redirect` and `session token sent as URL query parameter`) in @strapi/plugin-users-permissions before version 4.24.2, is its possible of an unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms and retrieve the 3rd party tokens. The attack requires user interaction (one click). Unauthenticated attackers can leverage two vulnerabilities to obtain an 3rd party token and the bypass authentication of Strapi apps. Users should upgrade @strapi/plugin-users-permissions to version 4.24.2 to receive a patch. | [1]https://github.com/strapi/strapi/security/advisories/GHSA-wrvh-rcmr-9qfc |
| 9 | CVE-2024-37300 | 8.1  | HIGH | OAuthenticator is software that allows OAuth2 identity providers to be plugged in and used with JupyterHub. JupyterHub < 5.0, when used with `GlobusOAuthenticator`, could be configured to allow all users from a particular institution only. This worked fine prior to JupyterHub 5.0, because `allow_all` did not take precedence over `identity_provider`. Since JupyterHub 5.0, `allow_all` does take precedence over `identity_provider`. On a hub with the same config, now all users will be allowed to login, regardless of `identity_provider`. `identity_provider` will basically be ignored. This is a documented change in JupyterHub 5.0, but is likely to catch many users by surprise. OAuthenticator 16.3.1 fixes the issue with JupyterHub 5.0, and does not affect previous versions. As a workaround, do not upgrade to JupyterHub 5.0 when using `GlobusOAuthenticator` in the prior configuration. | [1]https://github.com/jupyterhub/oauthenticator/commit/d1aea05fa89f2beae15ab0fa0b0d071030f79654<br>[2]https://github.com/jupyterhub/oauthenticator/security/advisories/GHSA-gprj-3p75-f996<br>[3]https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/howto/upgrading-v5.html#authenticator-allow-all-and-allow-existing-users |
