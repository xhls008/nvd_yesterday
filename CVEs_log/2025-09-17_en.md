A remote attacker with access to a signed third-party or demo certificate for client authentication can bypass the need for a certificate signed by the certificate authority of the organization during authentication on the Control-M/Agent.The Control-M/Agent contains hardcoded certificates which are only trusted as fallback if an empty kdb keystore is used; they are never trusted if a PKCS#12 keystore is used. All of these certificates are now expired.In addition, the Control-M/Agent default kdb and PKCS#12 keystores contain trusted third-party certificates (external recognized CAs and default self-signed demo certificates) which are trusted for client authentication. | [1]https://bmcapps.my.site.com/casemgmt/sc_KnowledgeArticle?sfdcid=000441963<br>[2]https://bmcapps.my.site.com/casemgmt/sc_KnowledgeArticle?sfdcid=000442099 |

| 30 | CVE-2025-59050 | 8.4  | HIGH | Greenshot is an open source Windows screenshot utility. Greenshot 1.3.300 and earlier deserializes attacker-controlled data received in a WM_COPYDATA message using BinaryFormatter.Deserialize without prior validation or authentication, allowing a local process at the same integrity level to trigger arbitrary code execution inside the Greenshot process. The vulnerable logic resides in a WinForms WndProc handler for WM_COPYDATA (message 74) that copies the supplied bytes into a MemoryStream and invokes BinaryFormatter.Deserialize, and only afterward checks whether the specified channel is authorized. Because the authorization check occurs after deserialization, any gadget chain embedded in the serialized payload executes regardless of channel membership. A local attacker who can send WM_COPYDATA to the Greenshot main window can achieve in-process code execution, which may aid evasion of application control policies by running payloads within the trusted, signed Greenshot.exe process. This issue is fixed in version 1.3.301. No known workarounds exist. | [1]https://github.com/greenshot/greenshot/commit/f5a29a2ed3b0eb49231c0f4618300f488cf1b04d<br>[2]https://github.com/greenshot/greenshot/security/advisories/GHSA-8f7f-x7ww-xx5w<br>[3]https://github.com/greenshot/greenshot/security/advisories/GHSA-8f7f-x7ww-xx5w |
| 31 | CVE-2025-59334 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | Linkr is a lightweight file delivery system that downloads files from a webserver. Linkr versions through 2.0.0 do not verify the integrity or authenticity of .linkr manifest files before using their contents, allowing a tampered manifest to inject arbitrary file entries into a package distribution. An attacker can modify a generated .linkr manifest (for example by adding a new entry with a malicious URL) and when a user runs the extract command the client downloads the attacker-supplied file without verification. This enables arbitrary file injection and creates a potential path to remote code execution if a downloaded malicious binary or script is later executed. Version 2.0.1 adds a manifest integrity check that compares the checksum of the original author-created manifest to the one being extracted and aborts on mismatch, warning if no original manifest is hosted. Users should update to 2.0.1 or later. As a workaround prior to updating, use only trusted .linkr manifests, manually verify manifest integrity, and host manifests on trusted servers. | [1]https://github.com/mohammadzain2008/Linkr/commit/182e5ddaa51972e144005b500c4bcebf2fd1a6c0<br>[2]https://github.com/mohammadzain2008/Linkr/security/advisories/GHSA-6wph-mpv2-29xv<br>[3]https://github.com/mohammadzain2008/Linkr/security/advisories/GHSA-6wph-mpv2-29xv |
