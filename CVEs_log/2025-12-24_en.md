| 3 | CVE-2025-12934 | 8.1  | HIGH | The Beaver Builder – WordPress Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access and modification of data due to a missing capability check on the `duplicate_wpml_layout` function in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.4.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary posts with the content of other existing posts, potentially exposing private and password-protected content and deleting any content that is not saved in revisions or backups. Posts must have been created with Beaver Builder to be copied or updated. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/beaver-builder-lite-version/trunk/classes/class-fl-builder-model.php#L181<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/beaver-builder-lite-version/trunk/classes/class-fl-builder-model.php#L5490<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3425646/beaver-builder-lite-version/trunk<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/bc2db74d-61b9-498a-a0d8-e43466b06f37?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2025-14388 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The PhastPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Read via null byte injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.7. This is due to a discrepancy between the extension validation in `getExtensionForURL()` which operates on URL-decoded paths, and `appendNormalized()` which strips everything after a null byte before constructing the filesystem path. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files from the webroot, including wp-config.php, by appending a double URL-encoded null byte (%2500) followed by an allowed extension (.txt) to the file path. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/phastpress/tags/3.6/sdk/phast.php#L9570<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/phastpress/tags/3.6/sdk/phast.php#L9597<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/phastpress/tags/3.6/sdk/phast.php#L9608<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/phastpress/tags/3.6/sdk/phast.php#L9641<br>[5]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3418139<br>[6]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/eec9bbc0-5a68-4624-a672-bd6227d6fa45?source=cve |

| 42 | CVE-2025-68617 | 7.0  | HIGH | FluidSynth is a software synthesizer based on the SoundFont 2 specifications. From versions 2.5.0 to before 2.5.2, a race condition during unloading of a DLS file can trigger a heap-based use-after-free. A concurrently running thread may be pending to unload a DLS file, leading to use of freed memory, if the synthesizer is being concurrently destroyed, or samples of the (unloaded) DLS file are concurrently used to synthesize audio. This issue has been patched in version 2.5.2. The problem will not occur, when explicitly unloading a DLS file (before synth destruction), provided that at the time of unloading, no samples of the respective file are used by active voices. The problem will not occur in versions of FluidSynth that have been compiled without native DLS support. | [1]https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/commit/685e54cdc44911ace31774260bd0c9ec89887491<br>[2]https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/commit/962b9946b5cb6b16f0c08b89dd1b7016d4fce886<br>[3]https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/issues/1717<br>[4]https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/issues/1728<br>[5]https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/security/advisories/GHSA-ffw2-xvvp-39ch |
| 43 | CVE-2025-68664 | 9.3  | CRITICAL | LangChain is a framework for building agents and LLM-powered applications. Prior to versions 0.3.81 and 1.2.5, a serialization injection vulnerability exists in LangChain`s dumps() and dumpd() functions. The functions do not escape dictionaries with `lc` keys when serializing free-form dictionaries. The `lc` key is used internally by LangChain to mark serialized objects. When user-controlled data contains this key structure, it is treated as a legitimate LangChain object during deserialization rather than plain user data. This issue has been patched in versions 0.3.81 and 1.2.5. | [1]https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/commit/5ec0fa69de31bbe3d76e4cf9cd65a6accb8466c8<br>[2]https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/commit/d9ec4c5cc78960abd37da79b0250f5642e6f0ce6<br>[3]https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pull/34455<br>[4]https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pull/34458<br>[5]https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/releases/tag/langchain-core%3D%3D0.3.81<br>[6]https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/releases/tag/langchain-core%3D%3D1.2.5<br>[7]https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/security/advisories/GHSA-c67j-w6g6-q2cm |
| 44 | CVE-2025-68665 | 8.6  | HIGH | LangChain is a framework for building LLM-powered applications. Prior to @langchain/core versions 0.3.80 and 1.1.8, and prior to langchain versions 0.3.37 and 1.2.3, a serialization injection vulnerability exists in LangChain JS`s toJSON() method (and subsequently when string-ifying objects using JSON.stringify(). The method did not escape objects with `lc` keys when serializing free-form data in kwargs. The `lc` key is used internally by LangChain to mark serialized objects. When user-controlled data contains this key structure, it is treated as a legitimate LangChain object during deserialization rather than plain user data. This issue has been patched in @langchain/core versions 0.3.80 and 1.1.8, and langchain versions 0.3.37 and 1.2.3 | [1]https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/commit/e5063f9c6e9989ea067dfdff39262b9e7b6aba62<br>[2]https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/releases/tag/%40langchain%2Fcore%401.1.8<br>[3]https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/releases/tag/langchain%401.2.3<br>[4]https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/security/advisories/GHSA-r399-636x-v7f6 |
| 45 | CVE-2025-68669 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | 5ire is a cross-platform desktop artificial intelligence assistant and model context protocol client. In versions 0.15.2 and prior, an RCE vulnerability exists in useMarkdown.ts, where the markdown-it-mermaid plugin is initialized with securityLevel: `loose`. This configuration explicitly permits the rendering of HTML tags within Mermaid diagram nodes. This issue has not been patched at time of publication. | [1]https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire/blob/c40d05a2b546094789fc727daa5383bb15034442/src/hooks/useMarkdown.ts#L156<br>[2]https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire/releases/tag/v0.15.2<br>[3]https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire/security/advisories/GHSA-5hpf-p8fw-j349 |
