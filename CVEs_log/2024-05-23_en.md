| 1 | CVE-2024-3518 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Media Library Assistant plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the plugin`s shortcode(s) in all versions up to, and including, 3.15 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access or higher, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/media-library-assistant/trunk/includes/class-mla-shortcode-custom-list.php#L1971<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3069819%40media-library-assistant%2Ftrunk&old=3060779%40media-library-assistant%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=#file3<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/a7af1a03-8382-4593-a41f-8cdb1bb9e53b?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2024-4443 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Business Directory Plugin – Easy Listing Directories for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the ‘listingfields’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.2 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/business-directory-plugin/trunk/includes/fields/class-fieldtypes-select.php#L110<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3089626/<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/982fb304-08d6-4195-97a3-f18e94295492?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2024-2088 | 8.5  | HIGH | The NextScripts: Social Networks Auto-Poster plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.3 via the `nxs_getExpSettings` function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access and above, to extract sensitive data including social network API keys and secrets. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/social-networks-auto-poster-facebook-twitter-g/trunk/inc/nxs_functions_wp.php#L620<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3084635/social-networks-auto-poster-facebook-twitter-g/trunk/inc/nxs_functions_wp.php?contextall=1<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/70724bc7-c1f4-4965-8bba-99b2ed21d34b?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2024-4157 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Contact Form Plugin by Fluent Forms for Quiz, Survey, and Drag & Drop WP Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.15 via deserialization of untrusted input in the extractDynamicValues function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. Successful exploitation requires the attacker to have "View Form" and "Manage Form" permissions, which must be explicitly set by an administrator. However, this requirement can be bypassed when this vulnerability is chained with CVE-2024-2771. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3081740/fluentform<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/8def156a-f2f2-4640-a1c9-c21c74e1f308?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2024-5147 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The WPZOOM Addons for Elementor (Templates, Widgets) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.37 via the `grid_style` parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpzoom-elementor-addons/trunk/includes/wpzoom-elementor-ajax-posts-grid.php#L105<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpzoom-elementor-addons/trunk/includes/wpzoom-elementor-ajax-posts-grid.php#L112<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3090236#file6<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/f006bb33-d017-445b-9c02-bd848c199671?source=cve |
| 6 | CVE-2024-3495 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Country State City Dropdown CF7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the ‘cnt’ and `sid` parameters in versions up to, and including, 2.7.2 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/country-state-city-auto-dropdown/trunk/includes/ajax-actions.php#L22<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/country-state-city-auto-dropdown/trunk/includes/ajax-actions.php#L8<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3089374%40country-state-city-auto-dropdown%2Ftrunk&old=3068802%40country-state-city-auto-dropdown%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/17dcacaf-0e2a-4bef-b944-fb7e43d25777?source=cve |
| 7 | CVE-2024-5031 | 8.5  | HIGH | The Memberpress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Blind Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.11.29 via the `mepr-user-file` shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and modify information from internal services. | [1]https://memberpress.com/change-log/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/80064e3b-6996-49eb-a475-0ffe0e894f9e?source=cve |

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3088562%40piotnet-addons-for-elementor&old=3048934%40piotnet-addons-for-elementor&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/812cc8f1-f89e-47c4-b029-f6a3dbc55d70?source=cve |
| 9 | CVE-2023-20239 | 8.8  | HIGH | A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks on an affected system. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not adequately validate user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application and sending crafted SQL queries to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain any data from the database, execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system, and elevate privileges to root. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need at least Read Only user credentials. | [1]https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fmc-sqli-WFFDnNOs |
| 10 | CVE-2024-36077 | 8.8  | HIGH | Qlik Sense Enterprise for Windows before 14.187.4 allows a remote attacker to elevate their privilege due to improper validation. The attacker can elevate their privilege to the internal system role, which allows them to execute commands on the server. This affects February 2024 Patch 3 (14.173.3 through 14.173.7), November 2023 Patch 8 (14.159.4 through 14.159.13), August 2023 Patch 13 (14.139.3 through 14.139.20), May 2023 Patch 15 (14.129.3 through 14.129.22), February 2023 Patch 13 (14.113.1 through 14.113.18), November 2022 Patch 13 (14.97.2 through 14.97.18), August 2022 Patch 16 (14.78.3 through 14.78.23), and May 2022 Patch 17 (14.67.7 through 14.67.31).
