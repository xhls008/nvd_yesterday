| 6 | CVE-2025-69217 | 7.7  | HIGH | coturn is a free open source implementation of TURN and STUN Server. Versions 4.6.2r5 through 4.7.0-r4 have a bad random number generator for nonces and port randomization after refactoring. Additionally, random numbers aren`t generated with openssl`s RAND_bytes but libc`s random() (if it`s not running on Windows). When fetching about 50 sequential nonces (i.e., through sending 50 unauthenticated allocations requests) it is possible to completely reconstruct the current state of the random number generator, thereby predicting the next nonce. This allows authentication while spoofing IPs. An attacker can send authenticated messages without ever receiving the responses, including the nonce (requires knowledge of the credentials, which is e.g., often the case in IoT settings). Since the port randomization is deterministic given the pseudorandom seed, an attacker can exactly reconstruct the ports and, hence predict the randomization of the ports. If an attacker allocates a relay port, they know the current port, and they are able to predict the next relay port (at least if it is not used before). Commit 11fc465f4bba70bb0ad8aae17d6c4a63a29917d9 contains a fix. | [1]https://github.com/coturn/coturn/commit/11fc465f4bba70bb0ad8aae17d6c4a63a29917d9<br>[2]https://github.com/coturn/coturn/commit/88ced471385869d7e7fbbc4766e78ef521b36af6<br>[3]https://github.com/coturn/coturn/security/advisories/GHSA-fvj6-9jhg-9j84 |

In versions prior to 1.0.0-alpha.77, RustFS implements gRPC authentication using a hardcoded static token `"rustfs rpc"` that is publicly exposed in the source code repository, hardcoded on both client and server sides, non-configurable with no mechanism for token rotation, and universally valid across all RustFS deployments. Any attacker with network access to the gRPC port can authenticate using this publicly known token and execute privileged operations including data destruction, policy manipulation, and cluster configuration changes. Version 1.0.0-alpha.77 contains a fix for the issue. | [1]https://github.com/rustfs/rustfs/security/advisories/GHSA-h956-rh7x-ppgj |

| 48 | CVE-2025-69256 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Serverless Framework is a framework for using AWS Lambda and other managed cloud services to build applications. Starting in version 4.29.0 and prior to version 4.29.3, a command injection vulnerability exists in the Serverless Framework`s built-in MCP server package (@serverless/mcp). This vulnerability only affects users of the experimental MCP server feature (serverless mcp), which represents less than 0.1% of Serverless Framework users. The core Serverless Framework CLI and deployment functionality are not affected. The vulnerability is caused by the unsanitized use of input parameters within a call to `child_process.exec`, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the server process`s privileges. The server constructs and executes shell commands using unvalidated user input directly within command-line strings. This introduces the possibility of shell metacharacter injection (`|`, `>`, `&&`, etc.). Version 4.29.3 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/6213453da7df375aaf12fb3522ab8870488fc59a/packages/mcp/src/tools/list-projects.js#L68<br>[2]https://github.com/serverless/serverless/commit/681ca039550c7169369f98780c6301a00f2dc4c4<br>[3]https://github.com/serverless/serverless/releases/tag/sf-core%404.29.3<br>[4]https://github.com/serverless/serverless/security/advisories/GHSA-rwc2-f344-q6w6 |
