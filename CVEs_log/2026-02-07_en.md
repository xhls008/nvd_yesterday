| 1 | CVE-2025-15566 | 8.8  | HIGH | A security issue was discovered in ingress-nginx where the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-proxy-set-headers` Ingress annotation can be used to inject configuration into nginx. This can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the ingress-nginx controller, and disclosure of Secrets accessible to the controller. (Note that in the default installation, the controller can access all Secrets cluster-wide.) | [1]https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/136789 |
| 2 | CVE-2026-1499 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The WP Duplicate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization leading to Arbitrary File Upload in all versions up to and including 1.1.8. This is due to a missing capability check on the `process_add_site()` AJAX action combined with path traversal in the file upload functionality. This makes it possible for authenticated (subscriber-level) attackers to set the internal `prod_key_random_id` option, which can then be used by an unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication checks and write arbitrary files to the server via the `handle_upload_single_big_file()` function, ultimately leading to remote code execution. | [1]https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/862.html<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/local-sync/tags/1.1.8/admin/class-local-sync-admin.php#L422<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/local-sync/tags/1.1.8/admin/class-local-sync-files-op.php#L843<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/local-sync/tags/1.1.8/includes/class-local-sync-handle-server-requests.php#L389<br>[5]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/local-sync/trunk/admin/class-local-sync-admin.php#L422<br>[6]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/local-sync/trunk/admin/class-local-sync-files-op.php#L843<br>[7]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/local-sync/trunk/includes/class-local-sync-handle-server-requests.php#L389<br>[8]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3452904%40local-sync&old=3400317%40local-sync&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[9]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/11bb7190-023b-45e1-99a5-7313c489ef45?source=cve |

| 36 | CVE-2026-25640 | 7.1  | HIGH | Pydantic AI is a Python agent framework for building applications and workflows with Generative AI. From 1.34.0 to before 1.51.0,  a path traversal vulnerability in the Pydantic AI web UI allows an attacker to serve arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the application by crafting a malicious URL. In affected versions, the CDN URL is constructed using a version query parameter from the request URL. This parameter is not validated, allowing path traversal sequences that cause the server to fetch and serve attacker-controlled HTML/JavaScript from an arbitrary source on the same CDN, instead of the legitimate chat UI package. If a victim clicks the link or visits it via an iframe, attacker-controlled code executes in their browser, enabling theft of chat history and other client-side data. This vulnerability only affects applications that use Agent.to_web to serve a chat interface and clai web to serve a chat interface from the CLI. These are typically run locally (on localhost), but may also be deployed on a remote server. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.51.0. | [1]https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/releases/tag/v1.51.0<br>[2]https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/security/advisories/GHSA-wjp5-868j-wqv7 |
| 37 | CVE-2026-25641 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | SandboxJS is a JavaScript sandboxing library. Prior to 0.8.29, there is a sandbox escape vulnerability due to a mismatch between the key on which the validation is performed and the key used for accessing properties. Even though the key used in property accesses is annotated as string, this is never enforced. So, attackers can pass malicious objects that coerce to different string values when used, e.g., one for the time the key is sanitized using hasOwnProperty(key) and a different one for when the key is used for the actual property access. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.8.29. | [1]https://github.com/nyariv/SandboxJS/blob/6103d7147c4666fe48cfda58a4d5f37005b43754/src/executor.ts#L304-L304<br>[2]https://github.com/nyariv/SandboxJS/commit/67cb186c41c78c51464f70405504e8ef0a6e43c3<br>[3]https://github.com/nyariv/SandboxJS/security/advisories/GHSA-7x3h-rm86-3342<br>[4]https://github.com/nyariv/SandboxJS/security/advisories/GHSA-7x3h-rm86-3342 |

Prior to 0.16.4, a critical Remote Command Execution (RCE) vulnerability has been identified in the Frigate integration with go2rtc. The application does not sanitize user input in the video stream configuration (config.yaml), allowing direct injection of system commands via the exec: directive. The go2rtc service executes these commands without restrictions. This vulnerability is only exploitable by an administrator or users who have exposed their Frigate install to the open internet with no authentication which allows anyone full administrative control.

| 43 | CVE-2026-25632 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | EPyT-Flow is a Python package designed for the easy generation of hydraulic and water quality scenario data of water distribution networks. Prior to 0.16.1, EPyT-Flow’s REST API parses attacker-controlled JSON request bodies using a custom deserializer (my_load_from_json) that supports a type field. When type is present, the deserializer dynamically imports an attacker-specified module/class and instantiates it with attacker-supplied arguments. This allows invoking dangerous classes such as subprocess.Popen, which can lead to OS command execution during JSON parsing. This also affects the loading of JSON files. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.16.1. | [1]https://github.com/WaterFutures/EPyT-Flow/commit/3fff9151494c7dbc72073830b734f0a7e550e385<br>[2]https://github.com/WaterFutures/EPyT-Flow/releases/tag/v0.16.1<br>[3]https://github.com/WaterFutures/EPyT-Flow/security/advisories/GHSA-74vm-8frp-7w68 |

| 46 | CVE-2026-25636 | 8.2  | HIGH | calibre is an e-book manager. In 9.1.0 and earlier, a path traversal vulnerability in Calibre`s EPUB conversion allows a malicious EPUB file to corrupt arbitrary existing files writable by the Calibre process. During conversion, Calibre resolves CipherReference URI from META-INF/encryption.xml to an absolute filesystem path and opens it in read-write mode, even when it points outside the conversion extraction directory.

Prior to 0.101.0, a critical timing attack vulnerability in Trilium`s sync authentication endpoint allows unauthenticated remote attackers to recover HMAC authentication hashes byte-by-byte through statistical timing analysis. This enables complete authentication bypass without password knowledge, granting full read/write access to victim`s knowledge base.

| 52 | CVE-2026-25732 | 7.5  | HIGH | NiceGUI is a Python-based UI framework. Prior to 3.7.0, NiceGUI`s FileUpload.name property exposes client-supplied filename metadata without sanitization, enabling path traversal when developers use the pattern UPLOAD_DIR / file.name. Malicious filenames containing ../ sequences allow attackers to write files outside intended directories, with potential for remote code execution through application file overwrites in vulnerable deployment patterns. This design creates a prevalent security footgun affecting applications following common community patterns. Note: Exploitation requires application code incorporating file.name into filesystem paths without sanitization. Applications using fixed paths, generated filenames, or explicit sanitization are not affected.
