A specially crafted WinBioControlUnit call can lead to memory corruption. An attacker can issue an api call to trigger this vulnerability. This vulnerability is triggered when submitting a `WinBioControlUnit` call to the StorageAdapter with the ControlCode 0 (`WBIO_USH_GET_TEMPLATE`) and with either `0 < ReceiveBuferSize < 4`  and/or `0 < SendBufferSize < 76`. The former will lead to an out-of-bound write of up to 3 bytes and the latter will trigger an out-of-bound read of up to 75 bytes. | [1]https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2025-2175<br>[2]https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000326061/dsa-2025-228 |
| 43 | CVE-2025-36462 | 7.3  | HIGH | Multiple out-of-bounds read and write vulnerabilities exist in the ControlVault WBDI Driver Broadcom Storage Adapter functionality of Dell ControlVault3 prior to 5.15.14.19 and Dell ControlVault3 Plus prior to 6.2.36.47. A specially crafted WinBioControlUnit call can lead to memory corruption. An attacker can issue an api call to trigger this vulnerability. This vulnerability is triggered when submitting a `WinBioControlUnit` call to the StorageAdapter with the ControlCode 3 (`WBIO_USH_CREATE_CHALLENGE`) and with  `0 < ReceiveBuferSize < 4`. Up to three null-bytes will be written past the end of the `ReceiveBuffer`. | [1]https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2025-2175<br>[2]https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000326061/dsa-2025-228 |
| 44 | CVE-2025-36463 | 7.3  | HIGH | Multiple out-of-bounds read and write vulnerabilities exist in the ControlVault WBDI Driver Broadcom Storage Adapter functionality of Dell ControlVault3 prior to 5.15.14.19 and Dell ControlVault3 Plus prior to 6.2.36.47. A specially crafted WinBioControlUnit call can lead to memory corruption. An attacker can issue an api call to trigger this vulnerability. This vulnerability is triggered when submitting a `WinBioControlUnit` call to the StorageAdapter with the ControlCode 4 (`WBIO_USH_ADD_RECORD`) and with  `0 < SendBufferSize < 104`. A various amount of bytes can be read ouf of bound past the end the `SendBuffer`. The constraints surrounding this exploitation are pretty tough and may make the exploitation of this vulnerability less likely or limited to a Denial of Services. | [1]https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2025-2175<br>[2]https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000326061/dsa-2025-228 |
| 45 | CVE-2025-36553 | 8.8  | HIGH | A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the CvManager functionality of Dell ControlVault3 prior to 5.15.14.19 and Dell ControlVault3 Plus prior to 6.2.36.47. A specially crafted ControlVault API call can lead to memory corruption. An attacker can issue an api call to trigger this vulnerability. | [1]https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2025-2189<br>[2]https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000326061/dsa-2025-228<br>[3]https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2025-2189 |
