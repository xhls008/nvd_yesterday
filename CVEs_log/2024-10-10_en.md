| 1 | CVE-2024-25286 | 8.8  | HIGH | 3DSecure 2.0 allows CSRF in the Authorization Method via modified Origin and Referer HTTP headers. | [1]https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Sep/31 |
| 2 | CVE-2024-35288 | 7.8  | HIGH | Nitro PDF Pro before 13.70.8.82 and 14.x before 14.26.1.0 allows Local Privilege Escalation in the MSI Installer because custom actions occur unsafely in repair mode. CertUtil is run in a conhost.exe window, and there is a mechanism allowing CTRL+o to launch cmd.exe as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. | [1]https://sec-consult.com/vulnerability-lab/advisory/local-privilege-escalation-via-msi-installer-in-nitro-pdf-pro/<br>[2]https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Sep/59<br>[3]https://www.gonitro.com/support/downloads#securityUpdates |
| 3 | CVE-2024-45179 | 7.2  | HIGH | An issue was discovered in za-internet C-MOR Video Surveillance 5.2401 and 6.00PL01. Due to insufficient input validation, the C-MOR web interface is vulnerable to OS command injection attacks. It was found out that different functionality is vulnerable to OS command injection attacks, for example for generating new X.509 certificates, or setting the time zone. These OS command injection vulnerabilities in the script generatesslreq.pml can be exploited as a low-privileged authenticated user to execute commands in the context of the Linux user www-data via shell metacharacters in HTTP POST data (e.g., the city parameter). The OS command injection vulnerability in the script settimezone.pml or setdatetime.pml (e.g., via the year parameter) requires an administrative user for the C-MOR web interface. By also exploiting a privilege-escalation vulnerability, it is possible to execute commands on the C-MOR system with root privileges. | [1]https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2024-030.txt |

Systems without BGP traceoptions enabled are not affected by this issue.This issue affects iBGP and eBGP with any address family configured.This issue affects:Junos OS:   *  All versions before 21.4R3-S8,  *  22.2 before 22.2R3-S5,   *  22.3 before 22.3R3-S4,   *  22.4 before 22.4R3-S3,   *  23.2 before 23.2R2-S2,   *  23.4 before 23.4R2; Junos OS Evolved:   *  All versions before 21.4R3-S8-EVO,   *  22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S5-EVO,   *  22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-S4-EVO,   *  22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S3-EVO,   *  23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S2-EVO,   *  23.4-EVO before 23.4R2-EVO. | [1]https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA88100 |
| 53 | CVE-2024-39525 | 7.5  | HIGH | An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker sending a specific BGP packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.This issue only affects systems with BGP traceoptions enabled and requires a BGP session to be already established.  Systems without BGP traceoptions enabled are not affected by this issue.This issue affects iBGP and eBGP, and both IPv4 and IPv6 are affected by this vulnerability.This issue affects:Junos OS:   *  All versions before 21.2R3-S8,   *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S8,   *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S4,   *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S4,  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S3,   *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S1,   *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2; Junos OS Evolved:   *  All versions before 21.2R3-S8-EVO,   *  from 21.4-EVO before 21.4R3-S8-EVO,   *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S4-EVO,   *  from 22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-S4-EVO,  *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S3-EVO,   *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S1-EVO,   *  from 23.4-EVO before 23.4R2-EVO. | [1]https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA88102<br>[2]https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/cli-reference/topics/ref/statement/traceoptions-edit-protocols-bgp.html |
