| 1 | CVE-2025-29981 | 7.5  | HIGH | Dell Wyse Management Suite, versions prior to WMS 5.1, contains an Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker with remote access could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to Information disclosure. | [1]https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000296515/dsa-2025-135 |
| 2 | CVE-2025-3066 | 8.8  | HIGH | Use after free in Navigations in Google Chrome prior to 135.0.7049.52 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page. (Chromium security severity: High) | [1]https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2025/04/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html<br>[2]https://issues.chromium.org/issues/405140652 |
| 3 | CVE-2025-3067 | 8.8  | HIGH | Inappropriate implementation in Custom Tabs in Google Chrome on Android prior to 135.0.7049.52 allowed a remote attacker who convinced a user to engage in specific UI gestures to perform privilege escalation via a crafted app. (Chromium security severity: Medium) | [1]https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2025/04/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html<br>[2]https://issues.chromium.org/issues/376491759 |
| 4 | CVE-2023-40714 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | A relative path traversal in Fortinet FortiSIEM versions 7.0.0, 6.7.0 through 6.7.2, 6.6.0 through 6.6.3, 6.5.1, 6.5.0 allows attacker to escalate privilege via uploading certain GUI elements | [1]https://fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-23-085 |
| 5 | CVE-2024-39780 | 8.4  | HIGH | A YAML deserialization vulnerability was found in the Robot Operating System (ROS) `dynparam`, a command-line tool for getting, setting, and deleting parameters of a dynamically configurable node, affecting ROS distributions Noetic and earlier. The issue is caused by the use of the yaml.load() function in the `set` and `get` verbs, and allows for the creation of arbitrary Python objects. Through this flaw, a local or remote user can craft and execute arbitrary Python code. This issue has now been fixed for ROS Noetic via commit 3d93ac13603438323d7e9fa74e879e45c5fe2e8e. | [1]https://github.com/ros/dynamic_reconfigure/pull/202 |
| 6 | CVE-2025-2005 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Front End Users plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the file uploads field of the registration form in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.32. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/front-end-only-users/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/102223a1-07f5-485b-a6af-49cf316d9797?source=cve |
| 7 | CVE-2025-3063 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Shopper Approved Reviews plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the ajax_callback_update_sa_option() function in versions 2.0 to 2.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/shopperapproved-reviews/trunk/shopperapproved.php#L154<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c042b347-2884-436d-abd3-6931548f18d6?source=cve |
| 8 | CVE-2025-30090 | 7.2  | HIGH | mime.php in SquirrelMail through 1.4.23-svn-20250401 and 1.5.x through 1.5.2-svn-20250401 allows XSS via e-mail headers, because JavaScript payloads are mishandled after $encoded has been set to true. | [1]https://squirrelmail.org<br>[2]https://squirrelmail.org/security/issue.php?d=2025-04-02 |
| 9 | CVE-2024-45064 | 8.5  | HIGH | A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the FileX Internal RAM interface functionality of STMicroelectronics X-CUBE-AZRTOS-WL 2.0.0. A specially crafted set of network packets can lead to code execution. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger this vulnerability. | [1]https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-2096<br>[2]https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-2096 |
| 10 | CVE-2025-31722 | 8.8  | HIGH | In Jenkins Templating Engine Plugin 2.5.3 and earlier, libraries defined in folders are not subject to sandbox protection, allowing attackers with Item/Configure permission to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM. | [1]https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2025-04-02/#SECURITY-3505 |
| 11 | CVE-2024-36328 | 7.3  | HIGH | Integer overflow within AMD NPU Driver could allow a local attacker to write out of bounds, potentially leading to loss of integrity or availability. | [1]https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7037.html |
| 12 | CVE-2024-36336 | 7.9  | HIGH | Integer overflow within the AMD NPU Driver could allow a local attacker to write out of bounds, potentially leading to a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. | [1]https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7037.html |
| 13 | CVE-2024-36337 | 7.9  | HIGH | Integer overflow within AMD NPU Driver could allow a local attacker to write out of bounds, potentially leading to loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability. | [1]https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7037.html |
| 14 | CVE-2025-0014 | 7.3  | HIGH | Incorrect default permissions on the AMD Ryzen(TM) AI installation folder could allow an attacker to achieve privilege escalation, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution. | [1]https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7037.html |
| 15 | CVE-2025-31479 | 8.2  | HIGH | canonical/get-workflow-version-action is a GitHub composite action to get commit SHA that GitHub Actions reusable workflow was called with. Prior to 1.0.1, if the get-workflow-version-action step fails, the exception output may include the GITHUB_TOKEN. If the full token is included in the exception output, GitHub will automatically redact the secret from the GitHub Actions logs. However, the token may be truncated—causing part of the GITHUB_TOKEN to be displayed in plaintext in the GitHub Actions logs. Anyone with read access to the GitHub repository can view GitHub Actions logs. For public repositories, anyone can view the GitHub Actions logs. The opportunity to exploit this vulnerability is limited—the GITHUB_TOKEN is automatically revoked when the job completes. However, there is an opportunity for an attack in the time between the GITHUB_TOKEN being displayed in the logs and the completion of the job. Users using the github-token input are impacted. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.1. | [1]https://github.com/canonical/get-workflow-version-action/commit/88281a62e96e1c0ef4df30352ae0668a9f3e3369<br>[2]https://github.com/canonical/get-workflow-version-action/issues/2<br>[3]https://github.com/canonical/get-workflow-version-action/security/advisories/GHSA-26wh-cc3r-w6pj |
