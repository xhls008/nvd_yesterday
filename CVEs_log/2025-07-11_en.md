| 1 | CVE-2025-5023 | 7.1  | HIGH | Use of Hard-coded Credentials vulnerability in Mitsubishi Electric Corporation photovoltaic system monitor “EcoGuideTAB” PV-DR004J all versions and PV-DR004JA all versions allows an attacker within the Wi-Fi communication range between the units of the product (measurement unit and display unit) to disclose information such as generated power and electricity sold back to the grid stored in the product, tamper with or destroy stored or configured information in the product, or cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition on the product, by using hardcoded user ID and password common to the product series obtained by exploiting CVE-2025-5022. However, the product is not affected by this vulnerability when it remains unused for a certain period of time (default: 5 minutes) and enters the power-saving mode with the display unit`s LCD screen turned off. The affected products discontinued in 2015, support ended in 2020. | [1]https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2025-007_en.pdf |
| 2 | CVE-2025-6948 | 8.7  | HIGH | An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 17.11 before 17.11.6, 18.0 before 18.0.4, and 18.1 before 18.1.2 that, under certain conditions, could have allowed a successful attacker to execute actions on behalf of users by injecting malicious content. | [1]https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/552616<br>[2]https://hackerone.com/reports/3227316 |
| 3 | CVE-2025-5037 | 7.8  | HIGH | A maliciously crafted RFA file, when parsed through Autodesk Revit, can force a Memory Corruption vulnerability. A malicious actor can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. | [1]https://www.autodesk.com/trust/security-advisories/adsk-sa-2025-0012 |
| 4 | CVE-2025-5040 | 7.8  | HIGH | A maliciously crafted RTE file, when parsed through Autodesk Revit, can force a Heap-Based Overflow vulnerability.

| 5 | CVE-2025-7424 | 7.8  | HIGH | A flaw was found in the libxslt library. The same memory field, psvi, is used for both stylesheet and input data, which can lead to type confusion during XML transformations. This vulnerability allows an attacker to crash the application or corrupt memory. In some cases, it may lead to denial of service or unexpected behavior. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-7424<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2379228 |
| 6 | CVE-2025-7425 | 7.8  | HIGH | A flaw was found in libxslt where the attribute type, atype, flags are modified in a way that corrupts internal memory management. When XSLT functions, such as the key() process, result in tree fragments, this corruption prevents the proper cleanup of ID attributes. As a result, the system may access freed memory, causing crashes or enabling attackers to trigger heap corruption. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-7425<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2379274<br>[3]https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxslt/-/issues/140<br>[4]https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxslt/-/issues/140 |
| 7 | CVE-2025-27614 | 8.6  | HIGH | Gitk is a Tcl/Tk based Git history browser. Starting with 2.41.0, a Git repository can be crafted in such a way that with some social engineering a user who has cloned the repository can be tricked into running any script (e.g., Bourne shell, Perl, Python, ...) supplied by the attacker by invoking gitk filename, where filename has a particular structure. The script is run with the privileges of the user. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.43.7, 2.44.4, 2.45.4, 2.46.4, 2.47.3, 2.48.2, 2.49.1, and 2.50. | [1]https://github.com/j6t/gitk/commit/8e3070aa5e331be45d4d03e3be41f84494fce129<br>[2]https://github.com/j6t/gitk/security/advisories/GHSA-g4v5-fjv9-mhhc |
| 8 | CVE-2025-46334 | 8.6  | HIGH | Git GUI allows you to use the Git source control management tools via a GUI. A malicious repository can ship versions of sh.exe or typical textconv filter programs such as astextplain. Due to the unfortunate design of Tcl on Windows, the search path when looking for an executable always includes the current directory. The mentioned programs are invoked when the user selects Git Bash or Browse Files from the menu. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.43.7, 2.44.4, 2.45.4, 2.46.4, 2.47.3, 2.48.2, 2.49.1, and 2.50.1. | [1]https://github.com/j6t/git-gui/compare/dcda716dbc9c90bcac4611bd1076747671ee0906..a1ccd2512072cf52835050f4c97a4fba9f0ec8f9<br>[2]https://github.com/j6t/git-gui/security/advisories/GHSA-7px4-9hg2-fvhx |
| 9 | CVE-2025-46835 | 8.5  | HIGH | Git GUI allows you to use the Git source control management tools via a GUI. When a user clones an untrusted repository and is tricked into editing a file located in a maliciously named directory in the repository, then Git GUI can create and overwrite files for which the user has write permission. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.43.7, 2.44.4, 2.45.4, 2.46.4, 2.47.3, 2.48.2, 2.49.1, and 2.50.1. | [1]https://github.com/j6t/git-gui/compare/dcda716dbc9c90bcac4611bd1076747671ee0906..a437f5bc93330a70b42a230e52f3bd036ca1b1da<br>[2]https://github.com/j6t/git-gui/security/advisories/GHSA-xfx7-68v4-v8fg |

| 19 | CVE-2025-53542 | 7.7  | HIGH | Headlamp is an extensible Kubernetes web UI. A command injection vulnerability was discovered in the codeSign.js script used in the macOS packaging workflow of the Kubernetes Headlamp project. This issue arises due to the improper use of Node.js`s execSync() function with unsanitized input derived from environment variables, which can be influenced by an attacker. The variables ${teamID}, ${entitlementsPath}, and ${config.app} are dynamically derived from the environment or application config and passed directly to the shell command without proper escaping or argument separation. This exposes the system to command injection if any of the values contain malicious input. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.31.1. | [1]https://advisory.zerodaysec.org/advisory/kubernetes-headlamp-code-signing<br>[2]https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/headlamp/commit/5bc0a9dd87acdf1e04be14619acde687eefa35fb<br>[3]https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/headlamp/pull/3377<br>[4]https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/headlamp/security/advisories/GHSA-34rf-485x-g5h7 |
