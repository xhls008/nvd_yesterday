| 8 | CVE-2024-37305 | 8.2  | HIGH | oqs-provider is a provider for the OpenSSL 3 cryptography library that adds support for post-quantum cryptography in TLS, X.509, and S/MIME using post-quantum algorithms from liboqs. Flaws have been identified in the way oqs-provider handles lengths decoded with DECODE_UINT32 at the start of serialized hybrid (traditional + post-quantum) keys and signatures. Unchecked length values are later used for memory reads and writes; malformed input can lead to crashes or information leakage. Handling of plain/non-hybrid PQ key operation is not affected. This issue has been patched in in v0.6.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no workarounds for this issue. | [1]https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/416<br>[2]https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/security/advisories/GHSA-pqvr-5cr8-v6fx |
| 9 | CVE-2024-37890 | 7.5  | HIGH | ws is an open source WebSocket client and server for Node.js. A request with a number of headers exceeding theserver.maxHeadersCount threshold could be used to crash a ws server. The vulnerability was fixed in ws@8.17.1 (e55e510) and backported to ws@7.5.10 (22c2876), ws@6.2.3 (eeb76d3), and ws@5.2.4 (4abd8f6). In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the following ways: 1. Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the --max-http-header-size=size and/or the maxHeaderSize options so that no more headers than the server.maxHeadersCount limit can be sent. 2. Set server.maxHeadersCount to 0 so that no limit is applied. | [1]https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/22c28763234aa75a7e1b76f5c01c181260d7917f<br>[2]https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/4abd8f6de4b0b65ef80b3ff081989479ed93377e<br>[3]https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/e55e5106f10fcbaac37cfa89759e4cc0d073a52c<br>[4]https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/eeb76d313e2a00dd5247ca3597bba7877d064a63<br>[5]https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230<br>[6]https://github.com/websockets/ws/pull/2231<br>[7]https://github.com/websockets/ws/security/advisories/GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q<br>[8]https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#servermaxheaderscount |
| 10 | CVE-2024-37896 | 8.8  | HIGH | Gin-vue-admin is a backstage management system based on vue and gin. Gin-vue-admin <= v2.6.5 has SQL injection vulnerability. The SQL injection vulnerabilities occur when a web application allows users to input data into SQL queries without sufficiently validating or sanitizing the input. Failing to properly enforce restrictions on user input could mean that even a basic form input field can be used to inject arbitrary and potentially dangerous SQL commands. This could lead to unauthorized access to the database, data leakage, data manipulation, or even complete compromise of the database server. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `53d033821` which has been included in release version 2.6.6. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin/commit/53d03382188868464ade489ab0713b54392d227f<br>[2]https://github.com/flipped-aurora/gin-vue-admin/security/advisories/GHSA-gf3r-h744-mqgp |
