| 5 | CVE-2025-9054 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The MultiLoca - WooCommerce Multi Locations Inventory Management plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the `wcmlim_settings_ajax_handler` function in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.8. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site. | [1]https://codecanyon.net/item/woocommerce-multi-locations-inventory-management/28949586#item-description__changelog<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6a04e6ad-9365-4cb5-a0a0-82e047647d6b?source=cve |

| 11 | CVE-2025-48868 | 7.2  | HIGH | Horilla is a free and open source Human Resource Management System (HRMS). An authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in Horilla 1.3.0 due to the unsafe use of Python’s eval() function on a user-controlled query parameter in the project_bulk_archive view. This allows privileged users (e.g., administrators) to execute arbitrary system commands on the server. While having Django’s DEBUG=True makes exploitation visibly easier by returning command output in the HTTP response, this is not required. The vulnerability can still be exploited in DEBUG=False mode by using blind payloads such as a reverse shell, leading to full remote code execution. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.1. | [1]https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XQAJilt77QxkjGEa94CsZRqZIZXa3ET9/view?usp=sharing<br>[2]https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hnI9AK3fnpVrTlTRF7aRJsKhZCDIm2Ve/view?usp=sharing<br>[3]https://github.com/horilla-opensource/horilla/commit/b0aab62b3a5fe6b7114b5c58db129b3744b4d8cc<br>[4]https://github.com/horilla-opensource/horilla/security/advisories/GHSA-h6qj-pwmx-wjhw |

| 40 | CVE-2025-56815 | 7.1  | HIGH | Datart 1.0.0-rc.3 is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in the POST /viz/image interface, since the server directly uses MultipartFile.transferTo() to save the uploaded file to a path controllable by the user, and lacks strict verification of the file name. | [1]https://github.com/running-elephant/datart/tags<br>[2]https://github.com/xiaoxiaoranxxx/CVE-2025-56815 |
| 41 | CVE-2025-56816 | 8.8  | HIGH | Datart 1.0.0-rc.3 is vulnerable to Directory Traversal. The configuration file handling of the application allows attackers to upload arbitrary YAML files to the config/jdbc-driver-ext.yml path. The application parses this file using SnakeYAML`s unsafe load() or loadAs() method without input sanitization. This allows deserialization of attacker-controlled YAML content, leading to arbitrary class instantiation. Under certain conditions, this can be exploited to achieve remote code execution (RCE). | [1]https://github.com/running-elephant/datart<br>[2]https://github.com/xiaoxiaoranxxx/CVE-2025-56815 |
| 42 | CVE-2025-48869 | 7.5  | HIGH | Horilla is a free and open source Human Resource Management System (HRMS). Unauthenticated users can access uploaded resume files in Horilla 1.3.0 by directly guessing or predicting file URLs. These files are stored in a publicly accessible directory, allowing attackers to retrieve sensitive candidate information without authentication. At time of publication there is no known patch. | [1]https://github.com/horilla-opensource/horilla/security/advisories/GHSA-99h5-x29f-727w |
| 43 | CVE-2025-57350 | 8.6  | HIGH | The csvtojson package, a tool for converting CSV data to JSON with customizable parsing capabilities, contains a prototype pollution vulnerability in versions prior to 2.0.10. This issue arises due to insufficient sanitization of nested header names during the parsing process in the parser_jsonarray component. When processing CSV input containing specially crafted header fields that reference prototype chains (e.g., using __proto__ syntax), the application may unintentionally modify properties of the base Object prototype. This vulnerability can lead to denial of service conditions or unexpected behavior in applications relying on unmodified prototype chains, particularly when untrusted CSV data is processed. The flaw does not require user interaction beyond providing a maliciously constructed CSV file. | [1]https://github.com/Keyang/node-csvtojson/issues/498<br>[2]https://github.com/VulnSageAgent/PoCs/tree/main/JavaScript/prototype-pollution/CVE-2025-57350 |

| 47 | CVE-2025-57323 | 7.5  | HIGH | mpregular is a package that provides a small program development framework based on RegularJS. A Prototype Pollution vulnerability in the mp.addEventHandler function of mpregular version 0.2.0 and before allows attackers to inject properties on Object.prototype via supplying a crafted payload, causing denial of service (DoS) as the minimum consequence. | [1]https://github.com/VulnSageAgent/PoCs/blob/main/JavaScript/prototype-pollution/mpregular%400.2.0/index.js<br>[2]https://github.com/VulnSageAgent/PoCs/tree/main/JavaScript/prototype-pollution/CVE-2025-57323 |
