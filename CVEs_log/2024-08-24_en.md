| 17 | CVE-2024-43782 | 7.7  | HIGH | This openedx-translations repository contains translation files from Open edX repositories to be kept in sync with Transifex. Before moving to pulling translations from the openedx-translations repository via openedx-atlas, translations in the edx-platform repository were validated using edx-i18n-tools. This validation included protection against malformed translations and translations-based script injections. Prior to this patch, the validation implemented in the openedx-translations repository did not include the same protections. The maintainer inspected the translations in the edx-platform directory of both the main and open-release/redwood.master branches of the openedx-translations repository and found no evidence of exploited translation strings. | [1]https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations/commit/3c4093705dec99590577c4d8270ce263f7fffc5a<br>[2]https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations/commit/b2444340e8702c7955310331c1db5fd85b25b92b<br>[3]https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations/security/advisories/GHSA-fg8c-2pvj-wx3j |
| 18 | CVE-2024-43791 | 7.8  | HIGH | RequestStore provides per-request global storage for Rack. The files published as part of request_store 1.3.2 have 0666 permissions, meaning that they are world-writable, which allows local users to execute arbitrary code. This version was published in 2017, and most production environments do not allow access for local users, so the chances of this being exploited are very low, given that the vast majority of users will have upgraded, and those that have not, if any, are not likely to be exposed. | [1]https://github.com/steveklabnik/request_store/security/advisories/GHSA-frp2-5qfc-7r8m |
