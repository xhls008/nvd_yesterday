| 43 | CVE-2025-66480 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Wildfire IM is an instant messaging and real-time audio/video solution. Prior to 1.4.3, a critical vulnerability exists in the im-server component related to the file upload functionality found in com.xiaoleilu.loServer.action.UploadFileAction. The application exposes an endpoint (/fs) that handles multipart file uploads but fails to properly sanitize the filename provided by the user. Specifically, the writeFileUploadData method directly concatenates the configured storage directory with the filename extracted from the upload request without stripping directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../../). This vulnerability allows an attacker to write arbitrary files to any location on the server`s filesystem where the application process has write permissions. By uploading malicious files (such as scripts, executables, or overwriting configuration files like authorized_keys or cron jobs), an attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) and completely compromise the server. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.3. | [1]https://github.com/wildfirechat/im-server/commit/2f9c4e028c01c64913cab32e7248bcca183a5230<br>[2]https://github.com/wildfirechat/im-server/releases/tag/1.4.3<br>[3]https://github.com/wildfirechat/im-server/security/advisories/GHSA-74hq-jhx2-fq6c |

| 51 | CVE-2026-25059 | 8.8  | HIGH | OpenList Frontend is a UI component for OpenList. Prior to 4.1.10, the application contains path traversal vulnerability in multiple file operation handlers in server/handles/fsmanage.go. Filename components in req.Names are directly concatenated with validated directories using stdpath.Join. This allows ".." sequences to bypass path restrictions, enabling users to access other users` files within the same storage mount and perform unauthorized actions such as deletion, renaming, or copying of files. An authenticated attacker can bypass directory-level authorisation by injecting traversal sequences into filename components, enabling unauthorised file removal and copying across user boundaries within the same storage mount. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.1.10. | [1]https://github.com/OpenListTeam/OpenList/commit/7b78fed106382430c69ef351d43f5d09928fff14<br>[2]https://github.com/OpenListTeam/OpenList/releases/tag/v4.1.10<br>[3]https://github.com/OpenListTeam/OpenList/security/advisories/GHSA-qmj2-8r24-xxcq |
| 52 | CVE-2026-25060 | 8.1  | HIGH | OpenList Frontend is a UI component for OpenList. Prior to 4.1.10, certificate verification is disabled by default for all storage driver communications. The TlsInsecureSkipVerify setting is default to true in the DefaultConfig() function in internal/conf/config.go. This vulnerability enables Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks by disabling TLS certificate verification, allowing attackers to intercept and manipulate all storage communications. Attackers can exploit this through network-level attacks like ARP spoofing, rogue Wi-Fi access points, or compromised internal network equipment to redirect traffic to malicious endpoints. Since certificate validation is skipped, the system will unknowingly establish encrypted connections with attacker-controlled servers, enabling full decryption, data theft, and manipulation of all storage operations without triggering any security warnings. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.1.10. | [1]https://github.com/OpenListTeam/OpenList/commit/e3c664f81d0584fbbdb86ffe6644be16259371c1<br>[2]https://github.com/OpenListTeam/OpenList/releases/tag/v4.1.10<br>[3]https://github.com/OpenListTeam/OpenList/security/advisories/GHSA-wf93-3ghh-h389 |
| 53 | CVE-2026-25137 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | The NixOs Odoo package is an open source ERP and CRM system. From 21.11 to before 25.11 and 26.05, every NixOS based Odoo setup publicly exposes the database manager without any authentication. This allows unauthorized actors to delete and download the entire database, including Odoos file store. Unauthorized access is evident from http requests. If kept, searching access logs and/or Odoos log for requests to /web/database can give indicators, if this has been actively exploited. The database manager is a featured intended for development and not meant to be publicly reachable. On other setups, a master password acts as 2nd line of defence. However, due to the nature of NixOS, Odoo is not able to modify its own configuration file and thus unable to persist the auto-generated password. This also applies when manually setting a master password in the web-UI. This means, the password is lost when restarting Odoo. When no password is set, the user is prompted to set one directly via the database manager. This requires no authentication or action by any authorized user or the system administrator. Thus, the database is effectively world readable by anyone able to reach Odoo. This vulnerability is fixed in 25.11 and 26.05. | [1]https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/485310<br>[2]https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/485454<br>[3]https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/security/advisories/GHSA-cwmq-6wv5-f3px |
| 54 | CVE-2026-25142 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | SandboxJS is a JavaScript sandboxing library. Prior to 0.8.27, SanboxJS does not properly restrict __lookupGetter__ which can be used to obtain prototypes, which can be used for escaping the sandbox / remote code execution. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.8.27. | [1]https://github.com/nyariv/SandboxJS/blob/f212a38fb5a6d4bc2bc2e2466c0c011ce8d41072/src/executor.ts#L368-L398<br>[2]https://github.com/nyariv/SandboxJS/commit/75c8009db32e6829b0ad92ca13bf458178442bd3<br>[3]https://github.com/nyariv/SandboxJS/security/advisories/GHSA-9p4w-fq8m-2hp7 |
