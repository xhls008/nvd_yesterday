|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2025-14736 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Frontend Admin by DynamiApps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 3.28.25. This is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied role values in the `validate_value`, `pre_update_value`, and `get_fields_display` functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register as administrators and gain complete control of the site, granted they can access a user registration form containing a Role field. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3427243/acf-frontend-form-element/trunk/main/frontend/fields/user/class-role.php<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/07eb71fc-6588-490d-8947-3077ec4a9045?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2025-15055 | 7.2  | HIGH | The SlimStat Analytics plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the `notes` and `resource` parameters in all versions up to, and including, 5.3.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever an administrator accesses the Recent Custom Events report. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3429990/wp-slimstat<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/afbfabfc-b923-4fe9-9e8f-0cf159f488db?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2025-15057 | 7.2  | HIGH | The SlimStat Analytics plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the `fh` (fingerprint) parameter in all versions up to, and including, 5.3.3. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the fingerprint value stored in the database. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever an administrator views the Real-time Access Log report. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3428488/wp-slimstat<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/90920df9-1362-466b-b14b-4714087f556b?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2025-70974 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | Fastjson before 1.2.48 mishandles autoType because, when an @type key is in a JSON document, and the value of that key is the name of a Java class, there may be calls to certain public methods of that class. Depending on the behavior of those methods, there may be JNDI injection with an attacker-supplied payload located elsewhere in that JSON document. This was exploited in the wild in 2023 through 2025. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-18349. Also, a later bypass is covered by CVE-2022-25845. | [1]https://cert.360.cn/warning/detail?id=7240aeab581c6dc2c9c5350756079955<br>[2]https://github.com/alibaba/fastjson/compare/1.2.47...1.2.48<br>[3]https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub/tree/master/fastjson/1.2.47-rce<br>[4]https://www.cloudsek.com/blog/androxgh0st-continues-exploitation-operators-compromise-a-us-university-for-hosting-c2-logger<br>[5]https://www.cnvd.org.cn/flaw/show/CNVD-2019-22238<br>[6]https://www.freebuf.com/vuls/208339.html<br>[7]https://www.seebug.org/vuldb/ssvid-98020 |
| 5 | CVE-2025-14657 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Eventin – Event Manager, Events Calendar, Event Tickets and Registrations plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the `post_settings` function in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.51. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin settings. Furthermore, due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the `etn_primary_color` setting, this enables unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that will execute whenever a user accesses a page where Eventin styles are loaded. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3429942/wp-event-solution/trunk/base/Enqueue/register.php?old=3390273&old_path=wp-event-solution%2Ftrunk%2Fbase%2FEnqueue%2Fregister.php<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3429942/wp-event-solution/trunk/base/api-handler.php?old=3390273&old_path=wp-event-solution%2Ftrunk%2Fbase%2Fapi-handler.php<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3429942/wp-event-solution/trunk/core/event/api.php?old=3390273&old_path=wp-event-solution%2Ftrunk%2Fcore%2Fevent%2Fapi.php<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e4188b26-80f8-41b8-be19-1ddcbd7e39f5?source=cve |
| 6 | CVE-2025-14741 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | The Frontend Admin by DynamiApps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to missing authorization to unauthorized data modification and deletion due to a missing capability check on the `delete_object` function in all versions up to, and including, 3.28.25. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary posts, pages, products, taxonomy terms, and user accounts. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/acf-frontend-form-element/tags/3.28.26/main/frontend/fields/general/class-delete-object.php?marks=106,119,132,142#L106<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/53adbab6-953a-4a6f-bbfc-89efdbdd28e0?source=cve |
| 7 | CVE-2025-14937 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Frontend Admin by DynamiApps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the `acff` parameter in the `frontend_admin/forms/update_field` AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 3.28.23 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3427236/acf-frontend-form-element<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/46c988ff-9cc5-4f2b-a3dd-06eaef5a7919?source=cve |
| 8 | CVE-2025-69194 | 8.8  | HIGH | A security issue was discovered in GNU Wget2 when handling Metalink documents. The application fails to properly validate file paths provided in Metalink <file name> elements. An attacker can abuse this behavior to write files to unintended locations on the system. This can lead to data loss or potentially allow further compromise of the user’s environment. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-69194<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2425773 |
| 9 | CVE-2025-69195 | 7.6  | HIGH | A flaw was found in GNU Wget2. This vulnerability, a stack-based buffer overflow, occurs in the filename sanitization logic when processing attacker-controlled URL paths, particularly when filename restriction options are active. A remote attacker can exploit this by providing a specially crafted URL, which, upon user interaction with wget2, can lead to memory corruption. This can cause the application to crash and potentially allow for further malicious activities. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-69195<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2425770 |
