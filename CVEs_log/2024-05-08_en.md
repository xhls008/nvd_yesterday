| 1 | CVE-2024-22472 | 8.1  | HIGH | A buffer Overflow vulnerability in Silicon Labs 500 Series Z-Wave devices may allow Denial of Service, and potential Remote Code executionThis issue affects all versions of Silicon Labs 500 Series SDK prior to v6.85.2running on Silicon Labs 500 series Z-wave devices. | [1]https://community.silabs.com/068Vm000004rZwm |
| 2 | CVE-2024-4186 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Build App Online plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 3.0.5. This is due to the `eb_user_email_verification_key` default value is empty, and the not empty check is missing in the `eb_user_email_verify` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the user id. This can only be exploited if the `Email Verification` setting is enabled. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/edwiser-bridge/tags/3.0.4/includes/class-eb-user-manager.php#L1571<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3081961/edwiser-bridge#file1<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6969d281-f280-4714-9859-38ac66e9cc60?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2024-4345 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Startklar Elementor Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type validation in the `process` function in the `startklarDropZoneUploadProcess` class in versions up to, and including, 1.7.13. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/startklar-elmentor-forms-extwidgets/trunk/startklarDropZoneUploadProcess.php?rev=3061298#L7<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3081987/startklar-elmentor-forms-extwidgets<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/4221b33c-5cfa-48db-92bf-bf25ff3c5a5f?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2024-4346 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | The Startklar Elementor Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.13. This is due to the plugin not properly validating the path of an uploaded file prior to deleting it. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files, including the wp-config.php file, which can make site takeover and remote code execution possible. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/startklar-elmentor-forms-extwidgets/trunk/startklarDropZoneUploadProcess.php?rev=3061298#L7<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3081987/startklar-elmentor-forms-extwidgets<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/a125bbf1-8ff6-4f3d-a4fb-caaaefe1df2a?source=cve |

| 12 | CVE-2024-32663 | 7.5  | HIGH | Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to 7.0.5 and 6.0.19, a small amount of HTTP/2 traffic can lead to Suricata using a large amount of memory. The issue has been addressed in Suricata 7.0.5 and 6.0.19. Workarounds include disabling the HTTP/2 parser and reducing `app-layer.protocols.http2.max-table-size` value (default is 65536). | [1]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/08d93f7c3762781b743f88f9fdc4389eb9c3eb64<br>[2]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/c0af92295e833d1db29b184d63cd3b829451d7fd<br>[3]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/d24b37a103c04bb2667e449e080ba4c8e56bb019<br>[4]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/e68ec4b227d19498f364a41eb25d3182f0383ca5<br>[5]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-9jxm-qw9v-266r<br>[6]https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/6892<br>[7]https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/6900 |
| 13 | CVE-2024-34084 | 7.5  | HIGH | Minder`s `HandleGithubWebhook` is susceptible to a denial of service attack from an untrusted HTTP request. The vulnerability exists before the request has been validated, and as such the request is still untrusted at the point of failure. This allows an attacker with the ability to send requests to `HandleGithubWebhook` to crash the Minder controlplane and deny other users from using it. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.0.48. | [1]https://github.com/stacklok/minder/commit/3e5a527d2f1b535159206161d1d519602c75bd0d<br>[2]https://github.com/stacklok/minder/security/advisories/GHSA-9c5w-9q3f-3hv7 |
| 14 | CVE-2024-34342 | 7.1  | HIGH | react-pdf displays PDFs in React apps. If PDF.js is used to load a malicious PDF, and PDF.js is configured with `isEvalSupported` set to `true` (which is the default value), unrestricted attacker-controlled JavaScript will be executed in the context of the hosting domain. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.7.3 and 8.0.2. | [1]https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/commit/85e64b5c16c9aaef738f421733c12911a441cec6<br>[2]https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/18015<br>[3]https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/security/advisories/GHSA-wgrm-67xf-hhpq<br>[4]https://github.com/wojtekmaj/react-pdf/commit/208f28dd47fe38c33ce4bac4205b2b0a0bb207fe<br>[5]https://github.com/wojtekmaj/react-pdf/commit/671e6eaa2e373e404040c13cc6b668fe39839cad<br>[6]https://github.com/wojtekmaj/react-pdf/security/advisories/GHSA-87hq-q4gp-9wr4 |
| 15 | CVE-2024-27273 | 8.1  | HIGH | IBM AIX`s Unix domain (AIX 7.2, 7.3, VIOS 3.1, and VIOS 4.1) datagram socket implementation could potentially expose applications using Unix domain datagram sockets with SO_PEERID operation and may lead to privilege escalation.  IBM X-Force ID:  284903. | [1]https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/284903<br>[2]https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/7150297 |
| 16 | CVE-2024-34346 | 8.4  | HIGH | Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure defaults. The Deno sandbox may be unexpectedly weakened by allowing file read/write access to privileged files in various locations on Unix and Windows platforms. For example, reading `/proc/self/environ` may provide access equivalent to `--allow-env`, and writing `/proc/self/mem` may provide access equivalent to `--allow-all`. Users who grant read and write access to the entire filesystem may not realize that these access to these files may have additional, unintended consequences. The documentation did not reflect that this practice should be undertaken to increase the strength of the security sandbox. Users who run code with `--allow-read` or `--allow-write` may unexpectedly end up granting additional permissions via file-system operations. Deno 1.43 and above require explicit `--allow-all` access to read or write `/etc`, `/dev` on unix platform (as well as `/proc` and `/sys` on linux platforms), and any path starting with `\\` on Windows. | [1]https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-23rx-c3g5-hv9w |
