| 1 | CVE-2025-4123 | 7.6  | HIGH | A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Grafana caused by combining a client path traversal and open redirect. This allows attackers to redirect users to a website that hosts a frontend plugin that will execute arbitrary JavaScript. This vulnerability does not require editor permissions and if anonymous access is enabled, the XSS will work. If the Grafana Image Renderer plugin is installed, it is possible to exploit the open redirect to achieve a full read SSRF.The default Content-Security-Policy (CSP) in Grafana will block the XSS though the `connect-src` directive. | [1]https://grafana.com/security/security-advisories/cve-2025-4123/ |

| 31 | CVE-2025-46715 | 7.8  | HIGH | Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems. Starting in version 1.3.0 and prior to version 1.15.12, Api_GetSecureParam fails to sanitize incoming pointers, and implicitly trusts that the pointer the user has passed in is safe to write to. GetRegValue then writes the contents of the SBIE registry entry selected to this address. An attacker can pass in a kernel pointer and the driver dumps the registry key contents we requested to it. This can be triggered by anyone on the system, including low integrity windows processes. Version 1.15.12 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/security/advisories/GHSA-67p9-6h73-ff7x |
