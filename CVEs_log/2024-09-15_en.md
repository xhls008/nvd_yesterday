|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2024-8271 | 7.3  | HIGH | The The FOX – Currency Switcher Professional for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.2.1. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode in the `woocs_get_custom_price_html` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woocommerce-currency-switcher/tags/1.4.2.1/classes/woocs.php#L4604<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3150596%40woocommerce-currency-switcher&new=3150596%40woocommerce-currency-switcher&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/dec51bd6-2ffe-47b6-9423-6131395bf439?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2024-8246 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Post Form – Registration Form – Profile Form for User Profiles – Frontend Content Forms for User Submissions (UGC) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.11. This is due to plugin not properly restricting what users have access to set the default role on registration forms. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to create a registration form with a custom role that allows them to register as administrators. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3149760/buddyforms/trunk/includes/admin/form-builder/meta-boxes/metabox-registration.php<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/40760f60-b81a-447b-a2c8-83c7666ce410?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2024-8479 | 7.3  | HIGH | The The Simple Spoiler plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in versions 1.2 to 1.3. This is due to the plugin adding the filter add_filter(`comment_text`, `do_shortcode`); which will run all shortcodes in comments. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/simple-spoiler/trunk/simple-spoiler.php#L108<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3151179%40simple-spoiler&new=3151179%40simple-spoiler&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/8ffc76d8-b841-4c26-bbc6-1f96664efe36?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2024-8669 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | The Backuply – Backup, Restore, Migrate and Clone plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the `options` parameter passed to the backuply_wp_clone_sql() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.4 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/backuply/trunk/functions.php#L1477<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3151205/<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6a061553-c988-4a31-a0a2-7a2608faa33f?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2024-6482 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Login with phone number plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.49. This is due to a lack of validation and missing capability check on user-supplied data in the `lwp_update_password_action` function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update their role to any other role, including Administrator. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 1.7.40. The login with phone number pro plugin was required to exploit the vulnerability in versions 1.7.40 - 1.7.49. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/login-with-phone-number/trunk/login-with-phonenumber.php#L3803<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3129185/<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/de7cde2c-142c-4004-9302-be335265d87d?source=cve |
