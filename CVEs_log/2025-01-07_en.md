| 20 | CVE-2025-21611 | 8.8  | HIGH | tgstation-server is a production scale tool for BYOND server management. Prior to 6.12.3, roles used to authorize API methods were incorrectly OR`d instead of AND`ed with the role used to determine if a user was enabled. This allows enabled users access to most, but not all, authorized actions regardless of their permissions. Notably, the WriteUsers right is unaffected so users may not use this bug to permanently elevate their account permissions. The fix is release in tgstation-server-v6.12.3. | [1]https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation-server/commit/e7b1189620baaf03c2d23f6e164d07c7c7d87d57<br>[2]https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation-server/issues/2064<br>[3]https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation-server/security/advisories/GHSA-rf5r-q276-vrc4 |

| 25 | CVE-2024-55605 | 7.5  | HIGH | Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to 7.0.8, a large input buffer to the to_lowercase, to_uppercase, strip_whitespace, compress_whitespace, dotprefix, header_lowercase, strip_pseudo_headers, url_decode, or xor transform can lead to a stack overflow causing Suricata to crash. The issue has been addressed in Suricata 7.0.8. | [1]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-x2hr-33vp-w289<br>[2]https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/7229 |
| 26 | CVE-2025-21613 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | go-git is a highly extensible git implementation library written in pure Go. An argument injection vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions prior to v5.13. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary values to git-upload-pack flags. This only happens when the file transport protocol is being used, as that is the only protocol that shells out to git binaries. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.13.0. | [1]https://github.com/go-git/go-git/security/advisories/GHSA-v725-9546-7q7m |
| 27 | CVE-2025-21614 | 7.5  | HIGH | go-git is a highly extensible git implementation library written in pure Go. A denial of service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions prior to v5.13. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform denial of service attacks by providing specially crafted responses from a Git server which triggers resource exhaustion in go-git clients. Users running versions of go-git from v4 and above are recommended to upgrade to v5.13 in order to mitigate this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/go-git/go-git/security/advisories/GHSA-r9px-m959-cxf4 |

| 31 | CVE-2024-55628 | 7.5  | HIGH | Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to version 7.0.8, DNS resource name compression can lead to small DNS messages containing very large hostnames which can be costly to decode, and lead to very large DNS log records. While there are limits in place, they were too generous. The issue has been addressed in Suricata 7.0.8. | [1]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/19cf0f81335d9f787d587450f7105ad95a648951<br>[2]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/37f4c52b22fcdde4adf9b479cb5700f89d00768d<br>[3]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/3a5671739f5b25e5dd973a74ca5fd8ea40e1ae2d<br>[4]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-96w4-jqwf-qx2j<br>[5]https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/7280 |
| 32 | CVE-2024-55629 | 7.5  | HIGH | Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to 7.0.8, TCP streams with TCP urgent data (out of band data) can lead to Suricata analyzing data differently than the applications at the TCP endpoints, leading to possible evasions. Suricata 7.0.8 includes options to allow users to configure how to handle TCP urgent data. In IPS mode, you can use a rule such as drop tcp any any -> any any (sid:1; tcp.flags:U*;) to drop all the packets with urgent flag set. | [1]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/6882bcb3e51bd3cf509fb6569cc30f48d7bb53d7<br>[2]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/779f9d8ba35c3f9b5abfa327d3a4209861bd2eb8<br>[3]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-69wr-vhwg-84h2<br>[4]https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/7411 |
| 33 | CVE-2024-55074 | 8.8  | HIGH | The edit profile function of Grocy through 4.3.0 allows stored XSS and resultant privilege escalation by uploading a crafted HTML or SVG file, a different issue than CVE-2024-8370. | [1]https://m10x.de/posts/2024/11/all-your-recipe-are-belong-to-us-part-1/3-stored-xss-csrf-and-broken-access-control-vulnerabilities-in-grocy/<br>[2]https://m10x.de/posts/2024/11/all-your-recipe-are-belong-to-us-part-1/3-stored-xss-csrf-and-broken-access-control-vulnerabilities-in-grocy/ |

| 35 | CVE-2024-46981 | 7.0  | HIGH | Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An authenticated user may use a specially crafted Lua script to manipulate the garbage collector and potentially lead to remote code execution. The problem is fixed in 7.4.2, 7.2.7, and 6.2.17. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from executing Lua scripts. This can be done using ACL to restrict EVAL and EVALSHA commands. | [1]https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/6.2.17<br>[2]https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/7.2.7<br>[3]https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/7.4.2<br>[4]https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-39h2-x6c4-6w4c |
| 36 | CVE-2025-21620 | 7.5  | HIGH | Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure defaults. When you send a request with the Authorization header to one domain, and the response asks to redirect to a different domain, Deno`sfetch() redirect handling creates a follow-up redirect request that keeps the original Authorization header, leaking its content to that second domain. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.1.2. | [1]https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-f27p-cmv8-xhm6 |
