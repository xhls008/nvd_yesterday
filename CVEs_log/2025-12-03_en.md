| 3 | CVE-2024-45675 | 8.4  | HIGH | IBM Informix Dynamic Server 14.10 could allow a local user on the system to log into the Informix server as administrator without a password. | [1]https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/7252704 |
| 4 | CVE-2025-12529 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Cost Calculator Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the deleteOrdersFiles() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary file paths into the orders that are removed, when an administrator deletes them. This can lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). This vulnerability requires the Cost Calculator Builder Pro version to be installed along with the free version in order to be exploitable. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/cost-calculator-builder/tags/3.6.1/includes/classes/CCBOrderController.php#L262<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/cost-calculator-builder/tags/3.6.1/includes/classes/CCBOrderController.php#L513<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/4154684d-3f9b-418f-b9d1-a5d22d4d84d3?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2025-20763 | 7.8  | HIGH | In mmdvfs, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check.

Patch ID: ALPS10267218; Issue ID: MSV-5032. | [1]https://corp.mediatek.com/product-security-bulletin/December-2025 |
| 6 | CVE-2025-20764 | 7.8  | HIGH | In smi, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check.

| 10 | CVE-2025-13387 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Kadence WooCommerce Email Designer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the customer name in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.17 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3399955/kadence-woocommerce-email-designer<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/1e0cf512-f676-4f47-abaa-5198998376b7?source=cve |
| 11 | CVE-2025-13000 | 7.7  | HIGH | The db-access WordPress plugin through 0.8.7 does not have authorization in an AJAX action, allowing any authenticated users, such as subscriber to perform SQLI attacks | [1]https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/aec53f87-6500-4c8a-925a-146be61bbabf/ |
| 12 | CVE-2025-13516 | 8.1  | HIGH | The SureMail – SMTP and Email Logs Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type in versions up to and including 1.9.0. This is due to the plugin`s save_file() function in inc/emails/handler/uploads.php which duplicates all email attachments to a web-accessible directory (wp-content/uploads/suremails/attachments/) without validating file extensions or content types. Files are saved with predictable names derived from MD5 hashes of their content. While the plugin attempts to protect this directory with an Apache .htaccess file to disable PHP execution, this protection is ineffective on nginx, IIS, and Lighttpd servers, or on misconfigured Apache installations. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to achieve Remote Code Execution by uploading malicious PHP files through any public form that emails attachments, calculating the predictable filename, and directly accessing the file to execute arbitrary code granted they are exploiting a site running on an affected web server configuration. | [1]https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/434.html<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/suremails/trunk/inc/admin/plugin.php#L407<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/suremails/trunk/inc/emails/handler/uploads.php#L113<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/suremails/trunk/inc/emails/handler/uploads.php#L231<br>[5]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3403145/suremails/trunk?contextall=1&old=3389326&old_path=%2Fsuremails%2Ftrunk<br>[6]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/f3a20047-a325-4d29-a848-7ffa525d0bad?source=cve |
| 13 | CVE-2025-13724 | 7.5  | HIGH | The VikRentCar Car Rental Management System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based blind SQL Injection via the `month` parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.4 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/vikrentcar/tags/1.4.4/admin/views/overv/view.html.php#L195<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/vikrentcar/trunk/admin/views/overv/view.html.php#L195<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3403439%40vikrentcar&new=3403439%40vikrentcar&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/724a2da0-e4e7-4868-a1ad-fce69a915981?source=cve |

| 28 | CVE-2025-13542 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The DesignThemes LMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.4. This is due to the `dtlms_register_user_front_end` function not restricting what user roles a user can register with. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to supply the `administrator` role during registration and gain administrator access to the site. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/egrad-education-wordpress-theme/42803015<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c880470f-3f81-47a2-b450-7074410e9f43?source=cve |
| 29 | CVE-2025-61940 | 8.3  | HIGH | NMIS/BioDose V22.02 and previous versions rely on a common SQL Server user account to access data in the database. User access in the client application is restricted by a password authentication check in the client software but the underlying database connection always has access. The latest version of NMIS/BioDose introduces an option to use Windows user authentication with the database, which would restrict this database connection. | [1]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-medical-advisories/icsma-25-336-01 |
| 30 | CVE-2025-62575 | 8.3  | HIGH | NMIS/BioDose V22.02 and previous versions rely on a Microsoft SQL Server database. The SQL user account `nmdbuser` and other created accounts by default have the sysadmin role. This can lead to remote code execution through the use of certain built-in stored procedures. | [1]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-medical-advisories/icsma-25-336-01 |
| 31 | CVE-2025-64298 | 8.4  | HIGH | NMIS/BioDose V22.02 and previous version installations where the embedded Microsoft SQLServer Express is used are exposed in the Windows share accessed by clients in networked installs. By default, this directory has insecure directory paths that allow access to the SQL Server database and configuration files, which can contain sensitive data. | [1]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-medical-advisories/icsma-25-336-01 |
| 32 | CVE-2025-64642 | 8.0  | HIGH | NMIS/BioDose V22.02 and previous versions` installation directory paths by default have insecure file permissions, which in certain deployment scenarios can enable users on client workstations to modify the program executables and libraries. | [1]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-medical-advisories/icsma-25-336-01 |
| 33 | CVE-2025-64778 | 7.3  | HIGH | NMIS/BioDose software V22.02 and previous versions contain executable binaries with plain text hard-coded passwords. These hard-coded passwords could allow unauthorized access to both the application and database. | [1]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-medical-advisories/icsma-25-336-01 |
| 34 | CVE-2025-66476 | 7.8  | HIGH | Vim is an open source, command line text editor. Prior to version 9.1.1947, an uncontrolled search path vulnerability on Windows allows Vim to execute malicious executables placed in the current working directory for the current edited file. On Windows, when using cmd.exe as a shell, Vim resolves external commands by searching the current working directory before system paths. When Vim invokes tools such as findstr for :grep, external commands or filters via :!, or compiler/:make commands, it may inadvertently run a malicious executable present in the same directory as the file being edited. The issue affects Vim for Windows prior to version 9.1.1947. | [1]https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/083ec6d9a3b7b09006e0ce69ac802597d25<br>[2]https://github.com/vim/vim/releases/tag/v9.1.1947<br>[3]https://github.com/vim/vim/security/advisories/GHSA-g77q-xrww-p834 |
