| 1 | CVE-2025-6379 | 8.8  | HIGH | The BeeTeam368 Extensions Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.4 via the handle_live_fn() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to perform actions on files outside of the originally intended directory. This vulnerability can be used to delete the wp-config.php file, which can be leveraged into a site takeover. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/vidmov-video-wordpress-theme/35542187<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/26abf509-f0a9-4849-9028-d6c42832158f?source=cve |
