| 1 | CVE-2025-8744 | 7.3  | HIGH | A vulnerability classified as critical was found in CesiumLab Web up to 4.0. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file /lodmodels/. The manipulation of the argument ID leads to sql injection. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way. | [1]https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.319240<br>[2]https://vuldb.com/?id.319240<br>[3]https://vuldb.com/?submit.616911 |
| 2 | CVE-2025-54996 | 7.2  | HIGH | OpenBao exists to provide a software solution to manage, store, and distribute sensitive data including secrets, certificates, and keys. In versions 2.3.1 and below, accounts with access to highly-privileged identity entity systems in root namespaces were able to increase their scope directly to the root policy. While the identity system allowed adding arbitrary policies, which in turn could contain capability grants on arbitrary paths, the root policy was restricted to manual generation using unseal or recovery key shares. The global root policy was not accessible from child namespaces. This issue is fixed in version 2.3.2. To workaround this vulnerability, use of denied_parameters in any policy which has access to the affected identity endpoints (on identity entities) may be sufficient to prohibit this type of attack. | [1]https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/1627<br>[2]https://github.com/openbao/openbao/releases/tag/v2.3.2<br>[3]https://github.com/openbao/openbao/security/advisories/GHSA-vf84-mxrq-crqc |
| 3 | CVE-2025-54997 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | OpenBao exists to provide a software solution to manage, store, and distribute sensitive data including secrets, certificates, and keys. In versions 2.3.1 and below, some OpenBao deployments intentionally limit privileged API operators from executing system code or making network connections. However, these operators can bypass both restrictions through the audit subsystem by manipulating log prefixes. This allows unauthorized code execution and network access that violates the intended security model. This issue is fixed in version 2.3.2. To workaround, users can block access to sys/audit/* endpoints using explicit deny policies, but root operators cannot be restricted this way. | [1]https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2025-14-privileged-vault-operator-may-execute-code-on-the-underlying-host/76033<br>[2]https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/1634<br>[3]https://github.com/openbao/openbao/releases/tag/v2.3.2<br>[4]https://github.com/openbao/openbao/security/advisories/GHSA-xp75-r577-cvhp |
| 4 | CVE-2025-55008 | 7.1  | HIGH | The AuthKit library for React Router 7+ provides helpers for authentication and session management using WorkOS & AuthKit with React Router. In versions 0.6.1 and below, @workos-inc/authkit-react-router exposed sensitive authentication artifacts — specifically sealedSession and accessToken by returning them from the authkitLoader. This caused them to be rendered into the browser HTML. This issue is fixed in version 0.7.0. | [1]https://github.com/workos/authkit-react-router/commit/607caac658784962bab76e227f9c5820d0b9a9e5<br>[2]https://github.com/workos/authkit-react-router/releases/tag/v0.7.0<br>[3]https://github.com/workos/authkit-react-router/security/advisories/GHSA-vqvc-9q8x-vmq6 |
| 5 | CVE-2025-55009 | 7.1  | HIGH | The AuthKit library for Remix provides convenient helpers for authentication and session management using WorkOS & AuthKit with Remix. In versions 0.14.1 and below, @workos-inc/authkit-remix exposed sensitive authentication artifacts — specifically sealedSession and accessToken — by returning them from the authkitLoader. This caused them to be rendered into the browser HTML. | [1]https://github.com/workos/authkit-remix/commit/20102afc74bf3dd5150a975a098067fb406b90b6<br>[2]https://github.com/workos/authkit-remix/releases/tag/v0.15.0<br>[3]https://github.com/workos/authkit-remix/security/advisories/GHSA-v3gr-w9gf-23cx |
| 6 | CVE-2025-55013 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | The Assemblyline 4 Service Client interfaces with the API to fetch tasks and publish the result for a service in Assemblyline 4. In versions below 4.6.1.dev138, the Assemblyline 4 Service Client (task_handler.py) accepts a SHA-256 value returned by the service server and uses it directly as a local file name.A malicious or compromised server (or any MITM that can speak to client) can return a path-traversal payload such as `../../../etc/cron.d/evil` and force the client to write the downloaded bytes to an arbitrary location on disk. This is fixed in version 4.6.1.dev138. | [1]https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/assemblyline-service-client/commit/351414e7e96cc1f5640ae71ae51b939e8ba30900<br>[2]https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/assemblyline/security/advisories/GHSA-75jv-vfxf-3865 |
