| 14 | CVE-2025-32380 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Apollo Router Core is a configurable, high-performance graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation 2. A vulnerability in Apollo Router`s usage of Apollo Compiler allowed queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments to be prohibitively expensive to validate. This could lead to excessive resource consumption and denial of service.  Apollo Router`s usage of Apollo Compiler has been updated so that validation logic processes each named fragment only once, preventing redundant traversal. This has been remediated in apollo-router versions 1.61.2 and 2.1.1. | [1]https://github.com/apollographql/router/commit/ab6675a63174715ea6ff50881fc957831d4e9564<br>[2]https://github.com/apollographql/router/commit/bba032e183b861348a466d3123c7137a1ae18952<br>[3]https://github.com/apollographql/router/security/advisories/GHSA-3j43-9v8v-cp3f |

Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.Under a rare timing scenario outside the attacker`s control, memory corruption may be observed when DHCP Option 82 is enabled, leading to an FPC crash and affecting packet forwarding. Due to the nature of the heap-based overflow, exploitation of this vulnerability could also lead to remote code execution within the FPC, resulting in complete control of the vulnerable component.This issue affects Junos OS on EX2300, EX3400, EX4100, EX4300, EX4300MP, EX4400, EX4600, EX4650-48Y, and QFX5k Series:   *  All versions before 21.4R3-S9,   *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S5,   *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S5,   *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3,   *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S3,   *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2. | [1]https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA96453 |

| 103 | CVE-2025-30648 | 7.4  | HIGH | An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the Juniper DHCP Daemon (jdhcpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause the jdhcpd process to crash resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).When a specifically malformed DHCP packet is received from a DHCP client, the jdhcpd process crashes, which will lead to the unavailability of the DHCP service and thereby resulting in a sustained DoS. The DHCP process will restart automatically to recover the service.This issue will occur when dhcp-security is enabled. This issue affects Junos OS:   *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9,   *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S10,   *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S6,   *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S6,   *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3,   *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S4,   *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2; Junos OS Evolved:   *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S6-EVO,   *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3-EVO,   *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S4-EVO,   *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2-EVO.. | [1]https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA96458 |
| 104 | CVE-2025-30649 | 7.5  | HIGH | An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the syslog stream TCP transport of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX240, MX480 and MX960 devices with MX-SPC3 Security Services Card allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker, to send specific spoofed packets to cause a CPU Denial of Service (DoS) to the MX-SPC3 SPUs.Continued receipt and processing of these specific packets will sustain the DoS condition.This issue affects Junos OS:  *  All versions before 22.2R3-S6,  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S4,  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3,  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S4,  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R1-S2, 24.2R2An indicator of compromise will indicate the SPC3 SPUs utilization has spiked.For example:    user@device> show services service-sets summary                     Service sets                                                                               CPU  Interface          configured       Bytes used             Session bytes used        Policy bytes used        utilization  "interface"          1              "bytes" (percent%)     "sessions" ("percent"%)   "bytes" ("percent"%)     99.97 % OVLD  <<<<<< look for high CPU usage | [1]https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA96459 |
| 105 | CVE-2025-30651 | 7.5  | HIGH | A Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).When an attacker sends a specific ICMPv6 packet to an interface with "protocols router-advertisement" configured, rpd crashes and restarts. Continued receipt of this packet will cause a sustained DoS condition. This issue only affects systems configured with IPv6.This issue affects Junos OS:   *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9,   *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S10,   *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S6,   *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S4,   *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S2,   *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2; and Junos OS Evolved:   *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9-EVO,   *  from 21.4-EVO before 21.4R3-S10-EVO,   *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S6-EVO,   *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S4-EVO,   *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S2-EVO,   *  from 23.4-EVO before 23.4R2-EVO. | [1]https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA96461 |
| 106 | CVE-2025-30656 | 7.5  | HIGH | An Improper Handling of Additional Special Element vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MS-MPC, MS-MIC and SPC3, and SRX Series, allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).If the SIP ALG processes specifically formatted SIP invites, a memory corruption will occur which will lead to a crash of the FPC processing these packets. Although the system will automatically recover with the restart of the FPC, subsequent SIP invites will cause the crash again and lead to a sustained DoS.This issue affects Junos OS on MX Series and SRX Series:   *  all versions before 21.2R3-S9,  *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S10,  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S6,  *  22.4 versions before 22.4R3-S5,  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2-S3,  *  23.4 versions before 23.4R2-S3,  *  24.2 versions before 24.2R1-S2, 24.2R2. | [1]https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA96466 |
| 107 | CVE-2025-30658 | 7.5  | HIGH | A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Anti-Virus processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).On all SRX platforms with Anti-Virus enabled, if a server sends specific content in the HTTP body of a response to a client request, these packets are queued by Anti-Virus processing in Juniper Buffers (jbufs) which are never released. When these jbufs are exhausted, the device stops forwarding all transit traffic.A jbuf memory leak can be noticed from the following logs:(<node>.)<fpc> Warning: jbuf pool id <#> utilization level (<current level>%) is above <threshold>%!To recover from this issue, the affected device needs to be manually rebooted to free the leaked jbufs.This issue affects Junos OS on SRX Series:   *  all versions before 21.2R3-S9,  *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S10,  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S6,  *  22.4 versions before 22.4R3-S6,  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2-S3,  *  23.4 versions before 23.4R2-S3,  *  24.2 versions before 24.2R2. | [1]https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA96469 |
| 108 | CVE-2025-30659 | 7.5  | HIGH | An Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).When a device configured for Secure Vector Routing (SVR) receives a specifically malformed packet the PFE will crash and restart.This issue affects Junos OS on SRX Series:  *  All 21.4 versions,  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S6,  *  22.4 versions before 22.4R3-S6,  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2-S3,  *  23.4 versions before 23.4R2-S4,  *  24.2 versions before 24.2R2.This issue does not affect versions before 21.4. | [1]https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA96470 |
| 109 | CVE-2025-30660 | 7.5  | HIGH | An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (pfe) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).When processing a high rate of specific GRE traffic destined to the device, the respective PFE will hang causing traffic forwarding to stop. When this issue occurs the following logs can be observed: <fpc #> MQSS(0): LI-3: Received a parcel with more than 512B accompanying data CHASSISD_FPC_ASIC_ERROR: ASIC Error detected <...>This issue affects Junos OS:  *  all versions before 21.2R3-S9,  *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S8,  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S4,  *  22.4 versions before 22.4R3-S5,  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2-S2,  *  23.4 versions before 23.4R2. | [1]https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA96471 |
