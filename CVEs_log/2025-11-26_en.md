| 1 | CVE-2025-62155 | 8.5  | HIGH | New API is a large language mode (LLM) gateway and artificial intelligence (AI) asset management system. Prior to version 0.9.6, a recently patched SSRF vulnerability contains a bypass method that can bypass the existing security fix and still allow SSRF to occur.Because the existing fix only applies security restrictions to the first URL request, a 302 redirect can bypass existing security measures and successfully access the intranet. This issue has been patched in version 0.9.6. | [1]https://github.com/QuantumNous/new-api/security/advisories/GHSA-9f46-w24h-69w4 |
| 2 | CVE-2025-64720 | 7.1  | HIGH | LIBPNG is a reference library for use in applications that read, create, and manipulate PNG (Portable Network Graphics) raster image files. From version 1.6.0 to before 1.6.51, an out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in png_image_read_composite when processing palette images with PNG_FLAG_OPTIMIZE_ALPHA enabled. The palette compositing code in png_init_read_transformations incorrectly applies background compositing during premultiplication, violating the invariant component ≤ alpha × 257 required by the simplified PNG API. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.51. | [1]https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/commit/08da33b4c88cfcd36e5a706558a8d7e0e4773643<br>[2]https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/issues/686<br>[3]https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/pull/751<br>[4]https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/security/advisories/GHSA-hfc7-ph9c-wcww<br>[5]https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/security/advisories/GHSA-hfc7-ph9c-wcww |
| 3 | CVE-2025-65018 | 7.1  | HIGH | LIBPNG is a reference library for use in applications that read, create, and manipulate PNG (Portable Network Graphics) raster image files.

| 21 | CVE-2025-64066 | 8.6  | HIGH | Primakon Pi Portal 1.0.18 REST /api/v2/user/register endpoint suffers from a Broken Access Control vulnerability. The endpoint fails to implement any authorization checks, allowing unauthenticated attackers to perform POST requests to register new user accounts in the application`s local database. This bypasses the intended security architecture, which relies on an external Identity Provider for initial user registration and assumes that internal user creation is an administrative-only function. This vector can also be chained with other vulnerabilities for privilege escalation and complete compromise of application. This specific request can be used to also enumerate already registered user accounts, aiding in social engineering or further targeted attacks. | [1]https://github.com/n3k7ar91/Vulnerabilites/blob/main/Primakon/CVE-2025-64066.md<br>[2]https://www.primakon.com/rjesenja/primakon-pcm/ |

| 26 | CVE-2025-58360 | 8.2  | HIGH | GeoServer is an open source server that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. From version 2.26.0 to before 2.26.2 and before 2.25.6, an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability was identified. The application accepts XML input through a specific endpoint /geoserver/wms operation GetMap. However, this input is not sufficiently sanitized or restricted, allowing an attacker to define external entities within the XML request. This issue has been patched in GeoServer 2.25.6, GeoServer 2.26.3, and GeoServer 2.27.0. | [1]https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/security/advisories/GHSA-fjf5-xgmq-5525<br>[2]https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-11682 |
| 27 | CVE-2025-62703 | 8.8  | HIGH | Fugue is a unified interface for distributed computing that lets users execute Python, Pandas, and SQL code on Spark, Dask, and Ray with minimal rewrites. In version 0.9.2 and prior, there is a remote code execution vulnerability by pickle deserialization via FlaskRPCServer. The Fugue framework implements an RPC server system for distributed computing operations. In the core functionality of the RPC server implementation, I found that the _decode() function in fugue/rpc/flask.py directly uses cloudpickle.loads() to deserialize data without any sanitization. This creates a remote code execution vulnerability when malicious pickle data is processed by the RPC server. The vulnerability exists in the RPC communication mechanism where the client can send arbitrary serialized Python objects that will be deserialized on the server side, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the victim`s machine. This issue has been patched via commit 6f25326. | [1]https://github.com/fugue-project/fugue/commit/6f25326779fd1f528198098d6287c5a863176fc0<br>[2]https://github.com/fugue-project/fugue/security/advisories/GHSA-xv5p-fjw5-vrj6 |
