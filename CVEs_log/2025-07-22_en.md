| 37 | CVE-2025-53832 | 7.5  | HIGH | Lara Translate MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server for Lara Translate API. Versions 0.0.11 and below contain a command injection vulnerability which exists in the @translated/lara-mcp MCP Server. The vulnerability is caused by the unsanitized use of input parameters within a call to child_process.exec, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the server process`s privileges. The server constructs and executes shell commands using unvalidated user input directly within command-line strings. This introduces the possibility of shell metacharacter injection (|, >, &&, etc.). This vulnerability is fixed in version 0.0.12. | [1]https://github.com/translated/lara-mcp/commit/e534ef690adf390e4ac862a200b2a83f6cf45944<br>[2]https://github.com/translated/lara-mcp/security/advisories/GHSA-xj5p-8h7g-76m7 |
