| 1 | CVE-2021-26383 | 7.9  | HIGH | Insufficient bounds checking in AMD TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) could allow an attacker with a compromised userspace to invoke a command with malformed arguments leading to out of bounds memory access, potentially resulting in loss of integrity or availability. | [1]https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/AMD-SB-4012.html<br>[2]https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/AMD-SB-5007.html<br>[3]https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/AMD-SB-6018.html |
| 2 | CVE-2025-58439 | 8.1  | HIGH | ERP is a free and open source Enterprise Resource Planning tool. In versions below 14.89.2 and 15.0.0 through 15.75.1, lack of validation of parameters left certain endpoints vulnerable to error-based SQL Injection. Some information like version could be retrieved. This issue is fixed in versions 14.89.2 and 15.76.0. | [1]https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/pull/49219<br>[2]https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/pull/49220<br>[3]https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/security/advisories/GHSA-fvjw-5w9q-6v39 |
| 3 | CVE-2025-7366 | 7.3  | HIGH | The The REHub - Price Comparison, Multi Vendor Marketplace Wordpress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 19.9.7. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/rehub-directory-multi-vendor-shop-coupon-affiliate-theme/7646339#item-description__19-9-8-15-augl-2025<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/4f726479-c170-4e84-a5a7-2a82d0f62ad0?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2025-58374 | 7.8  | HIGH | Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent that lives in users` editors. Versions 3.25.23 and below contain a default list of allowed commands that do not need manual approval if auto-approve is enabled, and npm install is included in that list. Because npm install executes lifecycle scripts, if a repository’s package.json file contains a malicious postinstall script, it would be executed automatically without user approval. This means that enabling auto-approved commands and opening a malicious repo could result in arbitrary code execution. This is fixed in version 3.26.0. | [1]https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7390/files<br>[2]https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/releases/tag/v3.26.0<br>[3]https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/security/advisories/GHSA-c292-qxq4-4p2v |
| 5 | CVE-2025-58437 | 8.1  | HIGH | Coder allows organizations to provision remote development environments via Terraform. In versions 2.22.0 through 2.24.3, 2.25.0  and 2.25.1, Coder can be compromised through insecure session handling in prebuilt workspaces. Coder automatically generates a session token for a user when a workspace is started. It is automatically exposed via coder_workspace_owner.session_token. Prebuilt workspaces are initially owned by a built-in prebuilds system user. When a prebuilt workspace is claimed, a new session token is generated for the user that claimed the workspace, but the previous session token for the prebuilds user was not expired. Any Coder workspace templates that persist this automatically generated session token are potentially impacted. This is fixed in versions 2.24.4 and 2.25.2. | [1]https://github.com/coder/coder/commit/06cbb2890f453cd522bb2158a6549afa3419c276<br>[2]https://github.com/coder/coder/commit/20d67d7d7191a4fd5d36a61c6fc1e23ab59befc0<br>[3]https://github.com/coder/coder/commit/ec660907faa0b0eae20fa2ba58ce1733f5f4b35a<br>[4]https://github.com/coder/coder/pull/19667<br>[5]https://github.com/coder/coder/pull/19668<br>[6]https://github.com/coder/coder/pull/19669<br>[7]https://github.com/coder/coder/security/advisories/GHSA-j6xf-jwrj-v5qp |
| 6 | CVE-2025-8359 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The AdForest theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.9. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user`s identity prior to authenticating them. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as other users, including administrators, without access to a password. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/adforest-classified-wordpress-theme/19481695<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c080df50-1113-484b-80ed-09515982c585?source=cve |
| 7 | CVE-2025-9515 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Multi Step Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via the import functionality in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.25. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://github.com/mlooft/multi-step-form/commit/590f9ac9d746b2a8aec0c12ba770252e86dc40ed<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3351951%40multi-step-form&new=3351951%40multi-step-form&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/af7dbb61-90b1-4a61-819e-bcef88b12b7f?source=cve |
| 8 | CVE-2025-7040 | 8.2  | HIGH | The Cloud SAML SSO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the `set_organization_settings` action of the csso_handle_actions() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.19. The handler reads client-supplied POST parameters for organization settings and passes them directly to update_option() without any check of the user’s capabilities or a CSRF nonce. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change critical configuration (including toggling signing and encryption), potentially breaking the SSO flow and causing a denial-of-service. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/cloud-sso-single-sign-on/tags/1.0.19/assets/CSSO_Init.php<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/cloud-sso-single-sign-on/tags/1.0.19/assets/base/CSSO_ActionHandler.php<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/cloud-sso-single-sign-on/tags/1.0.19/assets/base/CSSO_services.php<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/cloud-sso-single-sign-on/tags/1.0.19/saml-sso-plugin.php<br>[5]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/cloud-sso-single-sign-on/trunk/assets/base/CSSO_ActionHandler.php?rev=3354459#L202<br>[6]https://wordpress.org/plugins/cloud-sso-single-sign-on/#developers<br>[7]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/59622166-3316-42e5-bf28-69eb38231755?source=cve |
