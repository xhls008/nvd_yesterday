| 1 | CVE-2026-1490 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Spam protection, Anti-Spam, FireWall by CleanTalk plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized Arbitrary Plugin Installation due to an authorization bypass via reverse DNS (PTR record) spoofing on the `checkWithoutToken` function in all versions up to, and including, 6.71. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to install and activate arbitrary plugins which can be leveraged to achieve remote code execution if another vulnerable plugin is installed and activated. Note: This is only exploitable on sites with an invalid API key. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/cleantalk-spam-protect/trunk/lib/Cleantalk/ApbctWP/RemoteCalls.php#L69<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/cleantalk-spam-protect/trunk/lib/Cleantalk/Common/Helper.php#L64<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3454488/cleantalk-spam-protect#file473<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/cb603be6-4a12-49e1-b8cc-b2062eb97f16?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2026-1750 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Ecwid by Lightspeed Ecommerce Shopping Cart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 7.0.7. This is due to a missing capability check in the `save_custom_user_profile_fields` function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to supply the `ec_store_admin_access` parameter during a profile update and gain store manager access to the site. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ecwid-shopping-cart/tags/7.0.7/includes/class-ec-store-admin-access.php#L28<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3460721/ecwid-shopping-cart#file2<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/2d29f77c-b86d-4058-b528-27631e8a1f2e?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2025-32058 | 9.3  | CRITICAL | The Infotainment ECU manufactured by Bosch uses a RH850 module for CAN communication. RH850 is connected to infotainment over the INC interface through a custom protocol. There is a vulnerability during processing requests of this protocol on the V850 side which allows an attacker with code execution on the infotainment main SoC to perform code execution on the RH850 module and subsequently send arbitrary CAN messages over the connected CAN bus.First identified on Nissan Leaf ZE1 manufactured in 2020. | [1]http://i.blackhat.com/Asia-25/Asia-25-Evdokimov-Remote-Exploitation-of-Nissan-Leaf.pdf<br>[2]https://pcacybersecurity.com/resources/advisory/vulnerabilities-in-nissan-infotainment-manufactured-by-bosch<br>[3]https://www.nissan.co.uk/vehicles/new-vehicles/leaf.html |
| 4 | CVE-2025-32059 | 8.8  | HIGH | The specific flaw exists within the Bluetooth stack developed by Alps Alpine of the Infotainment ECU manufactured by Bosch. The issue results from the lack of proper boundary validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a stack-based buffer overflow when receiving a specific packet on the established upper layer L2CAP channel. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to obtain remote code execution on the Infotainment ECU with root privileges.First identified on Nissan Leaf ZE1 manufactured in 2020. | [1]http://i.blackhat.com/Asia-25/Asia-25-Evdokimov-Remote-Exploitation-of-Nissan-Leaf.pdf<br>[2]https://pcacybersecurity.com/resources/advisory/vulnerabilities-in-nissan-infotainment-manufactured-by-bosch<br>[3]https://www.nissan.co.uk/vehicles/new-vehicles/leaf.html |
| 5 | CVE-2025-32061 | 8.8  | HIGH | The specific flaw exists within the Bluetooth stack developed by Alps Alpine of the Infotainment ECU manufactured by Bosch.

| 7 | CVE-2026-2516 | 7.0  | HIGH | A vulnerability was identified in Unidocs ezPDF DRM Reader and ezPDF Reader 2.0/3.0.0.4 on 32-bit. This affects an unknown part in the library SHFOLDER.dll. Such manipulation leads to uncontrolled search path. The attack needs to be performed locally. Attacks of this nature are highly complex. It is indicated that the exploitability is difficult. The exploit is publicly available and might be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way. | [1]https://gofile.me/7bU54/ZG47Lh7Yx<br>[2]https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.346107<br>[3]https://vuldb.com/?id.346107<br>[4]https://vuldb.com/?submit.736172 |
| 8 | CVE-2026-26366 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | eNet SMART HOME server 2.2.1 and 2.3.1 ships with default credentials (user:user, admin:admin) that remain active after installation and commissioning without enforcing a mandatory password change. Unauthenticated attackers can use these default credentials to gain administrative access to sensitive smart home configuration and control functions. | [1]https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/jung-enet-smart-home-server-use-of-default-credent<br>[2]https://www.zeroscience.mk/en/vulnerabilities/ZSL-2026-5972.php |
| 9 | CVE-2026-26368 | 8.8  | HIGH | eNet SMART HOME server 2.2.1 and 2.3.1 contains a missing authorization vulnerability in the resetUserPassword JSON-RPC method that allows any authenticated low-privileged user (UG_USER) to reset the password of arbitrary accounts, including those in the UG_ADMIN and UG_SUPER_ADMIN groups, without supplying the current password or having sufficient privileges. By sending a crafted JSON-RPC request to /jsonrpc/management, an attacker can overwrite existing credentials, resulting in direct account takeover with full administrative access and persistent privilege escalation. | [1]https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/jung-enet-smart-home-server-account-takeover-via-r<br>[2]https://www.zeroscience.mk/en/vulnerabilities/ZSL-2026-5974.php |
| 10 | CVE-2026-26369 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | eNet SMART HOME server 2.2.1 and 2.3.1 contains a privilege escalation vulnerability due to insufficient authorization checks in the setUserGroup JSON-RPC method. A low-privileged user (UG_USER) can send a crafted POST request to /jsonrpc/management specifying their own username to elevate their account to the UG_ADMIN group, bypassing intended access controls and gaining administrative capabilities such as modifying device configurations, network settings, and other smart home system functions. | [1]https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/jung-enet-smart-home-server-privilege-escalation-v<br>[2]https://www.zeroscience.mk/en/vulnerabilities/ZSL-2026-5975.php |
