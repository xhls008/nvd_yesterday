| 1 | CVE-2025-15521 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Academy LMS – WordPress LMS Plugin for Complete eLearning Solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user`s identity prior to updating their password and relying solely on a publicly-exposed nonce for authorization. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user`s password, including administrators, and gain access to their account. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/academy/tags/3.5.0/includes/functions.php#L1581<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6687ebbe-fdf4-4ecb-bf59-034bb4b0104c?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2025-68133 | 7.4  | HIGH | EVerest is an EV charging software stack. In versions 2025.9.0 and below, an attacker can exhaust the operating system`s memory and cause the module to terminate by initiating an unlimited number of TCP connections that never proceed to ISO 15118-2 communication. This is possible because a new thread is started for each incoming plain TCP or TLS socket connection before any verification occurs, and the verification performed is too permissive. The EVerest processes and all its modules shut down, affecting all EVSE functionality. This issue is fixed in version 2025.10.0. | [1]https://github.com/EVerest/everest-core/commit/8127b8c54b296c4dd01b356ac26763f81f76a8fd<br>[2]https://github.com/EVerest/everest-core/commit/de504f0c11069010d26767b0952739e9a400cef3<br>[3]https://github.com/EVerest/everest-core/security/advisories/GHSA-mv3w-pp85-5h7c |
| 3 | CVE-2026-24061 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | telnetd in GNU Inetutils through 2.7 allows remote authentication bypass via a "-f root" value for the USER environment variable. | [1]https://www.gnu.org/software/inetutils/<br>[2]https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2026/01/20/2<br>[3]https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2026/01/20/8 |
| 4 | CVE-2026-22022 | 8.2  | HIGH | Deployments of Apache Solr 5.3.0 through 9.10.0 that rely on Solr`s "Rule Based Authorization Plugin" are vulnerable to allowing unauthorized access to certain Solr APIs, due to insufficiently strict input validation in those components.  Only deployments that meet all of the following criteria are impacted by this vulnerability:  *  Use of Solr`s "RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin"  *  A RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin config (see security.json) that specifies multiple "roles"  *  A RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin permission list (see security.json) that uses one or more of the following pre-defined permission rules: "config-read", "config-edit", "schema-read", "metrics-read", or "security-read".  *  A RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin permission list that doesn`t define the "all" pre-defined permission  *  A networking setup that allows clients to make unfiltered network requests to Solr. (i.e. user-submitted HTTP/HTTPS requests reach Solr as-is, unmodified or restricted by any intervening proxy or gateway)Users can mitigate this vulnerability by ensuring that their RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin configuration specifies the "all" pre-defined permission and associates the permission with an "admin" or other privileged role.  Users can also upgrade to a Solr version outside of the impacted range, such as the recently released Solr 9.10.1. | [1]https://lists.apache.org/thread/d59hqbgo7p62myq7mgfpz7or8n1j7wbn<br>[2]http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2026/01/20/4 |
| 5 | CVE-2026-22444 | 7.1  | HIGH | The "create core" API of Apache Solr 8.6 through 9.10.0 lacks sufficient input validation on some API parameters, which can cause Solr to check the existence of and attempt to read file-system paths that should be disallowed by Solr`s  "allowPaths" security setting https://https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/configuration-guide/configuring-solr-xml.html#the-solr-element .  These read-only accesses can allow users to create cores using unexpected configsets if any are accessible via the filesystem.  On Windows systems configured to allow UNC paths this can additionally cause disclosure of NTLM "user" hashes. Solr deployments are subject to this vulnerability if they meet the following criteria:  *  Solr is running in its "standalone" mode.  *  Solr`s "allowPath" setting is being used to restrict file access to certain directories.  *  Solr`s "create core" API is exposed and accessible to untrusted users.  This can happen if Solr`s  RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/deployment-guide/rule-based-authorization-plugin.html  is disabled, or if it is enabled but the "core-admin-edit" predefined permission (or an equivalent custom permission) is given to low-trust (i.e. non-admin) user roles.Users can mitigate this by enabling Solr`s RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin (if disabled) and configuring a permission-list that prevents untrusted users from creating new Solr cores.  Users should also upgrade to Apache Solr 9.10.1 or greater, which contain fixes for this issue. | [1]https://lists.apache.org/thread/qkrb9dd4xrlqmmq73lrhkbfkttto2d1m<br>[2]http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2026/01/20/5 |

| 49 | CVE-2025-68134 | 7.4  | HIGH | EVerest is an EV charging software stack. Prior to version 2025.10.0, the use of the `assert` function to handle errors frequently causes the module to crash. This is particularly critical because the manager shuts down all other modules and exits when any one of them terminates, leading to a denial of service. In a context where a manager handles multiple EVSE, this would also impact other users. Version 2025.10.0 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/EVerest/everest-core/security/advisories/GHSA-cxc5-rrj5-8pf3 |
| 50 | CVE-2025-68136 | 7.4  | HIGH | EVerest is an EV charging software stack. Prior to version 2025.10.0, once the module receives a SDP request, it creates a whole new set of objects like `Session`, `IConnection` which open new TCP socket for the ISO15118-20 communications and registers callbacks for the created file descriptor, without closing and destroying the previous ones. Previous `Session` is not saved and the usage of an `unique_ptr` is lost, destroying connection data. Latter, if the used socket and therefore file descriptor is not the last one, it will lead to a null pointer dereference. Version 2025.10.0 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/EVerest/everest-core/security/advisories/GHSA-4h8h-x5cp-g22r |
| 51 | CVE-2025-68137 | 8.3  | HIGH | EVerest is an EV charging software stack. Prior to version 2025.10.0, an integer overflow occurring in `SdpPacket::parse_header()` allows the current buffer length to be set to 7 after a complete header of size 8 has been read. The remaining length to read is computed using the current length subtracted by the header length which results in a negative value. This value is then interpreted as `SIZE_MAX` (or slightly less) because the expected type of the argument is `size_t`. Depending on whether the server is plain TCP or TLS, this leads to either an infinite loop or a stack buffer overflow. Version 2025.10.0 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/EVerest/everest-core/security/advisories/GHSA-7qq4-q9r8-wc7w |
| 52 | CVE-2025-68141 | 7.4  | HIGH | EVerest is an EV charging software stack. Prior to version 2025.10.0, during the deserialization of a `DC_ChargeLoopRes` message that includes Receipt as well as TaxCosts, the vector `<DetailedTax>tax_costs` in the target `Receipt` structure is accessed out of bounds. This occurs in the method `template <> void convert(const struct iso20_dc_DetailedTaxType& in, datatypes::DetailedTax& out)` which leads to a null pointer dereference and causes the module to terminate. The EVerest processes and all its modules shut down, affecting all EVSE. Version 2025.10.0 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/EVerest/everest-core/security/advisories/GHSA-ph4w-r9q8-vm9h |
| 53 | CVE-2026-22792 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | 5ire is a cross-platform desktop artificial intelligence assistant and model context protocol client. Prior to version 0.15.3, an unsafe HTML rendering permits untrusted HTML (including on* event attributes) to execute in the renderer context. An attacker can inject an `<img onerror=...>` payload to run arbitrary JavaScript in the renderer, which can call exposed bridge APIs such as `window.bridge.mcpServersManager.createServer`. This enables unauthorized creation of MCP servers and lead to remote command execution. Version 0.15.3 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire/releases/tag/v0.15.3<br>[2]https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire/security/advisories/GHSA-p5fm-wm8g-rffx |
| 54 | CVE-2026-22793 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | 5ire is a cross-platform desktop artificial intelligence assistant and model context protocol client. Prior to version 0.15.3, an unsafe option parsing vulnerability in the ECharts Markdown plugin allows any user able to submit ECharts code blocks to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the renderer context. This can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in environments where privileged APIs (such as Electron’s electron.mcp) are exposed, resulting in full compromise of the host system. Version 0.15.3 patches the issue. | [1]https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire/releases/tag/v0.15.3<br>[2]https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire/security/advisories/GHSA-wg3x-7c26-97wj |
| 55 | CVE-2026-22807 | 8.8  | HIGH | vLLM is an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs). Starting in version 0.10.1 and prior to version 0.14.0, vLLM loads Hugging Face `auto_map` dynamic modules during model resolution without gating on `trust_remote_code`, allowing attacker-controlled Python code in a model repo/path to execute at server startup. An attacker who can influence the model repo/path (local directory or remote Hugging Face repo) can achieve arbitrary code execution on the vLLM host during model load. This happens before any request handling and does not require API access. Version 0.14.0 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/commit/78d13ea9de4b1ce5e4d8a5af9738fea71fb024e5<br>[2]https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/32194<br>[3]https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/releases/tag/v0.14.0<br>[4]https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/GHSA-2pc9-4j83-qjmr |
| 56 | CVE-2026-23524 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Laravel Reverb provides a real-time WebSocket communication backend for Laravel applications. In versions 1.6.3 and below, Reverb passes data from the Redis channel directly into PHP’s unserialize() function without restricting which classes can be instantiated, which leaves users vulnerable to Remote Code Execution. The exploitability of this vulnerability is increased because Redis servers are commonly deployed without authentication, but only affects Laravel Reverb when horizontal scaling is enabled (REVERB_SCALING_ENABLED=true). This issue has been fixed in version 1.7.0. As a workaround, require a strong password for Redis access and ensure the service is only accessible via a private network or local loopback, and/or set REVERB_SCALING_ENABLED=false to bypass the vulnerable logic entirely (if the environment uses only one Reverb node). | [1]https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html<br>[2]https://github.com/laravel/reverb/commit/9ec26f8ffbb701f84920dd0bb9781a1797591f1a<br>[3]https://github.com/laravel/reverb/releases/tag/v1.7.0<br>[4]https://github.com/laravel/reverb/security/advisories/GHSA-m27r-m6rx-mhm4<br>[5]https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/reverb#scaling |
| 57 | CVE-2026-23736 | 7.3  | HIGH | seroval facilitates JS value stringification, including complex structures beyond JSON.stringify capabilities. In versions 1.4.0 and below, due to improper input validation, a malicious object key can lead to prototype pollution during JSON deserialization. This vulnerability affects only JSON deserialization functionality. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.1. | [1]https://github.com/lxsmnsyc/seroval/commit/ce9408ebc87312fcad345a73c172212f2a798060<br>[2]https://github.com/lxsmnsyc/seroval/security/advisories/GHSA-hj76-42vx-jwp4 |
| 58 | CVE-2026-23737 | 7.5  | HIGH | seroval facilitates JS value stringification, including complex structures beyond JSON.stringify capabilities. In versions 1.4.0 and below, improper input handling in the JSON deserialization component can lead to arbitrary JavaScript code execution. Exploitation is possible via overriding constant value and error deserialization, allowing indirect access to unsafe JS evaluation. At minimum, attackers need the ability to perform 4 separate requests on the same function, and partial knowledge of how the serialized data is used during later runtime processing. This vulnerability affects the fromJSON and fromCrossJSON functions in a client-to-server transmission scenario. This issue has been fixed in version 1.4.0. | [1]https://github.com/lxsmnsyc/seroval/commit/ce9408ebc87312fcad345a73c172212f2a798060<br>[2]https://github.com/lxsmnsyc/seroval/security/advisories/GHSA-3rxj-6cgf-8cfw |
| 59 | CVE-2026-24046 | 7.1  | HIGH | Backstage is an open framework for building developer portals. Multiple Scaffolder actions and archive extraction utilities were vulnerable to symlink-based path traversal attacks. An attacker with access to create and execute Scaffolder templates could exploit symlinks to read arbitrary files via the `debug:log` action by creating a symlink pointing to sensitive files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, configuration files, secrets); delete arbitrary files via the `fs:delete` action by creating symlinks pointing outside the workspace, and write files outside the workspace via archive extraction (tar/zip) containing malicious symlinks. This affects any Backstage deployment where users can create or execute Scaffolder templates. This vulnerability is fixed in `@backstage/backend-defaults` versions 0.12.2, 0.13.2, 0.14.1, and 0.15.0; `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend` versions 2.2.2, 3.0.2, and 3.1.1; and `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-node` versions 0.11.2 and 0.12.3. Users should upgrade to these versions or later. Some workarounds are available. Follow the recommendation in the Backstage Threat Model to limit access to creating and updating templates, restrict who can create and execute Scaffolder templates using the permissions framework, audit existing templates for symlink usage, and/or run Backstage in a containerized environment with limited filesystem access. | [1]https://github.com/backstage/backstage/commit/c641c147ab371a9a8a2f5f67fdb7cb9c97ef345d<br>[2]https://github.com/backstage/backstage/security/advisories/GHSA-rq6q-wr2q-7pgp |
