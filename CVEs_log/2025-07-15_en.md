| 25 | CVE-2025-27582 | 7.6  | HIGH | The Secure Password extension in One Identity Password Manager before 5.14.4 allows local privilege escalation. The issue arises from a flawed security hardening mechanism within the kiosk browser used to display the Password Self-Service site to end users. Specifically, the application attempts to restrict privileged actions by overriding the native window.print() function. However, this protection can be bypassed by an attacker who accesses the Password Self-Service site from the lock screen and navigates to an attacker-controlled webpage via the Help function. By hosting a crafted web page with JavaScript, the attacker can restore and invoke the window.print() function, launching a SYSTEM-privileged print dialog. From this dialog, the attacker can exploit standard Windows functionality - such as the Print to PDF or Add Printer wizard - to spawn a command prompt with SYSTEM privileges. Successful exploitation allows a local attacker (with access to a locked workstation) to gain SYSTEM-level privileges, granting full control over the affected device. | [1]https://www.cyberis.com/article/password-manager-privilege-escalation<br>[2]https://www.cyberis.com/article/password-manager-privilege-escalation |

| 36 | CVE-2025-53015 | 7.5  | HIGH | ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital images. In versions prior to 7.1.2-0, infinite lines occur when writing during a specific XMP file conversion command. Version 7.1.2-0 fixes the issue. | [1]https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iegkwlTjqnJTtM4XkiheYsjKsC6pxtId/view?usp=sharing<br>[2]https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/security/advisories/GHSA-vmhh-8rxq-fp9g |
| 37 | CVE-2025-53101 | 7.4  | HIGH | ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital images. In versions prior to 7.1.2-0 and 6.9.13-26, in ImageMagick`s `magick mogrify` command, specifying multiple consecutive `%d` format specifiers in a filename template causes internal pointer arithmetic to generate an address below the beginning of the stack buffer, resulting in a stack overflow through `vsnprintf()`. Versions 7.1.2-0 and 6.9.13-26 fix the issue. | [1]https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/66dc8f51c11b0ae1f1cdeacd381c3e9a4de69774<br>[2]https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/security/advisories/GHSA-qh3h-j545-h8c9 |
| 38 | CVE-2025-53819 | 7.9  | HIGH | Nix is a package manager for Linux and other Unix systems. Builds with Nix 2.30.0 on macOS were executed with elevated privileges (root), instead of the build users. The fix was applied to Nix 2.30.1.

| 39 | CVE-2025-53825 | 9.4  | CRITICAL | Dokploy is a free, self-hostable Platform as a Service (PaaS). Prior to version 0.24.3, an unauthenticated preview deployment vulnerability in Dokploy allows any user to execute arbitrary code and access sensitive environment variables by simply opening a pull request on a public repository. This exposes secrets and potentially enables remote code execution, putting all public Dokploy users using these preview deployments at risk. Version 0.24.3 contains a fix for the issue. | [1]https://github.com/Dokploy/dokploy/commit/1977235d313824b9764f1a06785fb7f73ab7eba2<br>[2]https://github.com/Dokploy/dokploy/security/advisories/GHSA-h67g-mpq5-6ph5 |
| 40 | CVE-2025-53833 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | LaRecipe is an application that allows users to create documentation with Markdown inside a Laravel app. Versions prior to 2.8.1 are vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), which could potentially lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in vulnerable configurations. Attackers could execute arbitrary commands on the server, access sensitive environment variables, and/or escalate access depending on server configuration. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to version v2.8.1 or later to receive a patch. | [1]https://github.com/saleem-hadad/larecipe/commit/c1d0d56889655ce5f2645db5acf0e78d5fc3b36b<br>[2]https://github.com/saleem-hadad/larecipe/pull/390<br>[3]https://github.com/saleem-hadad/larecipe/security/advisories/GHSA-jv7x-xhv2-p5v2 |
| 41 | CVE-2025-53835 | 9.0  | CRITICAL | XWiki Rendering is a generic rendering system that converts textual input in a given syntax (wiki syntax, HTML, etc) into another syntax (XHTML, etc). Starting in version 5.4.5 and prior to version 14.10, the XHTML syntax depended on the `xdom+xml/current` syntax which allows the creation of raw blocks that permit the insertion of arbitrary HTML content including JavaScript. This allows XSS attacks for users who can edit a document like their user profile (enabled by default). This has been fixed in version 14.10 by removing the dependency on the `xdom+xml/current` syntax from the XHTML syntax. Note that the `xdom+xml` syntax is still vulnerable to this attack. As it`s main purpose is testing and its use is quite difficult, this syntax shouldn`t be installed or used on a regular wiki. There are no known workarounds apart from upgrading. | [1]https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-rendering/commit/a4ca31f99f524b9456c64150d6f375984aa81ea7<br>[2]https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-rendering/security/advisories/GHSA-w3wh-g4m9-783p<br>[3]https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XRENDERING-660 |
