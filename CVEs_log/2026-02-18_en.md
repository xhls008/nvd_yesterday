| 1 | CVE-2025-12062 | 8.8  | HIGH | The WP Maps – Store Locator,Google Maps,OpenStreetMap,Mapbox,Listing,Directory & Filters plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 4.8.6 via the fc_load_template function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary .html files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where .html file types can be uploaded and included. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3405282/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/815e5b86-2d1b-4794-b761-dad770393d3e?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2026-2592 | 7.7  | HIGH | The Zarinpal Gateway for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Improper Access Control to Payment Status Update in all versions up to and including 5.0.16. This is due to the payment callback handler `Return_from_ZarinPal_Gateway` failing to validate that the authority token provided in the callback URL belongs to the specific order being marked as paid. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to potentially mark orders as paid without proper payment by reusing a valid authority token from a different transaction of the same amount. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/zarinpal-woocommerce-payment-gateway/trunk/class-wc-gateway-zarinpal.php#L359<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/zarinpal-woocommerce-payment-gateway/trunk/class-wc-gateway-zarinpal.php#L370<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/zarinpal-woocommerce-payment-gateway/trunk/class-wc-gateway-zarinpal.php#L380<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/zarinpal-woocommerce-payment-gateway/trunk/class-wc-gateway-zarinpal.php#L409<br>[5]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/zarinpal-woocommerce-payment-gateway/trunk/class-wc-gateway-zarinpal.php#L412<br>[6]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3445917/<br>[7]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e33fcd17-318b-408e-86bf-b4ece46121cc?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2026-1216 | 7.2  | HIGH | The RSS Aggregator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the `template` parameter in all versions up to, and including, 5.0.10 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-rss-aggregator/tags/5.0.10/core/src/Store/DisplaysStore.php#L106<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-rss-aggregator/trunk/core/src/Store/DisplaysStore.php#L106<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3439384%40wp-rss-aggregator%2Ftrunk&old=3421137%40wp-rss-aggregator%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/47a10dd4-515c-42d9-82ea-c84f8f7574c5?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2025-7631 | 8.6  | HIGH | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command (`SQL Injection`) vulnerability in Tumeva Internet Technologies Software Information Advertising and Consulting Services Trade Ltd. Co.

| 5 | CVE-2026-2615 | 7.2  | HIGH | A flaw has been found in Wavlink WL-NU516U1 up to 20251208. The affected element is the function singlePortForwardDelete of the file /cgi-bin/firewall.cgi. Executing a manipulation of the argument del_flag can lead to command injection. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been published and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way. | [1]https://github.com/Wlz1112/Wavlink-NU516U1-V251208-/blob/main/singlePortForwardDelete.md<br>[2]https://github.com/Wlz1112/Wavlink-NU516U1-V251208-/blob/main/singlePortForwardDelete.md#exp<br>[3]https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.346265<br>[4]https://vuldb.com/?id.346265<br>[5]https://vuldb.com/?submit.751047 |
| 6 | CVE-2026-25087 | 7.0  | HIGH | Use After Free vulnerability in Apache Arrow C++.This issue affects Apache Arrow C++ from 15.0.0 through 23.0.0. It can be triggered when reading an Arrow IPC file (but not an IPC stream) with pre-buffering enabled, if the IPC file contains data with variadic buffers (such as Binary View and String View data). Depending on the number of variadic buffers in a record batch column and on the temporal sequence of multi-threaded IO, a write to a dangling pointer could occur. The value (a `std::shared_ptr<Buffer>` object) that is written to the dangling pointer is not under direct control of the attacker.Pre-buffering is disabled by default but can be enabled using a specific C++ API call (`RecordBatchFileReader::PreBufferMetadata`). The functionality is not exposed in language bindings (Python, Ruby, C GLib), so these bindings are not vulnerable.The most likely consequence of this issue would be random crashes or memory corruption when reading specific kinds of IPC files. If the application allows ingesting IPC files from untrusted sources, this could plausibly be exploited for denial of service. Inducing more targeted kinds of misbehavior (such as confidential data extraction from the running process) depends on memory allocation and multi-threaded IO temporal patterns that are unlikely to be easily controlled by an attacker.Advice for users of Arrow C++:1. check whether you enable pre-buffering on the IPC file reader (using `RecordBatchFileReader::PreBufferMetadata`)2. if so, either disable pre-buffering (which may have adverse performance consequences), or switch to Arrow 23.0.1 which is not vulnerable | [1]https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/48925<br>[2]https://lists.apache.org/thread/mpm4ld1qony30tchfpjtk5b11tcyvmwh<br>[3]http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2026/02/17/4 |
| 7 | CVE-2026-22208 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | OpenS100 (the reference implementation S-100 viewer) prior to commit 753cf29 contain a remote code execution vulnerability via an unrestricted Lua interpreter. The Portrayal Engine initializes Lua using luaL_openlibs() without sandboxing or capability restrictions, exposing standard libraries such as `os` and `io` to untrusted portrayal catalogues. An attacker can provide a malicious S-100 portrayal catalogue containing Lua scripts that execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the OpenS100 process when a user imports the catalogue and loads a chart. | [1]https://github.com/S-100ExpertTeam/OpenS100/commit/753cf294434e8d3961f20a567c4d99151e3b530d<br>[2]https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/26/4/1246<br>[3]https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/opens100-portrayal-engine-unrestricted-lua-standard-library-access |
