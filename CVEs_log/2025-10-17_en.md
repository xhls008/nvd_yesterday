| 3 | CVE-2025-10706 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Classified Pro theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized plugin installation due to a missing capability check in the `cwp_addons_update_plugin_cb` function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.14. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to install arbitrary plugins on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. Note: The required nonce for the vulnerability is in the CubeWP Framework plugin. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/classifiedpro-recommerce-classified-wordpress-theme/44528010<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/2954583e-4ebe-4658-b132-0085f2b1cf08?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2025-10742 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Truelysell Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary User Password Change in versions up to, and including, 1.8.6. This is due to the plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization and access system resources. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts. Note: This can only be exploited unauthenticated if the attacker knows which page contains the `truelysell_edit_staff` shortcode. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/truelysell-service-booking-wordpress-theme/43398124<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/a636e865-9556-4afb-8726-4537a160f379?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2025-10850 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Felan Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to improper authentication in versions up to, and including, 1.1.4. This is due to the hardcoded password in the `fb_ajax_login_or_register` function and in the `google_ajax_login_or_register` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, if they registered with facebook or google social login and did not change their password. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/felan-freelance-marketplace-and-job-board-wordpress-theme/53612955<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/ab4c7656-544c-4f2f-a42f-264ac90e3b61?source=cve |

| 9 | CVE-2025-54539 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | A Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability exists in the Apache ActiveMQ NMS AMQP Client.This issue affects all versions of Apache ActiveMQ NMS AMQP up to and including 2.3.0, when establishing connections to untrusted AMQP servers. Malicious servers could exploit unbounded deserialization logic present in the client to craft responses that may lead to arbitrary code execution on the client side.Although version 2.1.0 introduced a mechanism to restrict deserialization via allow/deny lists, the protection was found to be bypassable under certain conditions.In line with Microsoft’s deprecation of binary serialization in .NET 9, the project is evaluating the removal of .NET binary serialization support from the NMS API entirely in future releases.Mitigation and Recommendations:Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to version 2.4.0 or later, which resolves the issue. Additionally, projects depending on NMS-AMQP should migrate away from .NET binary serialization as part of a long-term hardening strategy. | [1]https://lists.apache.org/thread/9k684j07ljrshy3hxwhj5m0xjmkz1g2n |

| 30 | CVE-2025-62506 | 8.1  | HIGH | MinIO is a high-performance object storage system. In all versions prior to RELEASE.2025-10-15T17-29-55Z, a privilege escalation vulnerability allows service accounts and STS (Security Token Service) accounts with restricted session policies to bypass their inline policy restrictions when performing operations on their own account, specifically when creating new service accounts for the same user. The vulnerability exists in the IAM policy validation logic where the code incorrectly relied on the DenyOnly argument when validating session policies for restricted accounts. When a session policy is present, the system should validate that the action is allowed by the session policy, not just that it is not denied. An attacker with valid credentials for a restricted service or STS account can create a new service account for itself without policy restrictions, resulting in a new service account with full parent privileges instead of being restricted by the inline policy. This allows the attacker to access buckets and objects beyond their intended restrictions and modify, delete, or create objects outside their authorized scope. The vulnerability is fixed in version RELEASE.2025-10-15T17-29-55Z. | [1]https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/c1a49490c78e9c3ebcad86ba0662319138ace190<br>[2]https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/21642<br>[3]https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-jjjj-jwhf-8rgr |
