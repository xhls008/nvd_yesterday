| No. | CVE ID | Base Score | Severity | Description | References |
|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2024-52867 | 8.1  | HIGH | guix-daemon in GNU Guix before 5ab3c4c allows privilege escalation because build outputs are accessible by local users before file metadata concerns (e.g., for setuid and setgid programs) are properly addressed. The vulnerability can be remediated within the product via certain pull, reconfigure, and restart actions. Both 5ab3c4c and 5582241 are needed to resolve the vulnerability. | [1]https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/commit/?id=558224140dab669cabdaebabff18504a066c48d4<br>[2]https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/commit/?id=5ab3c4c1e43ebb637551223791db0ea3519986e1<br>[3]https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2024/build-user-takeover-vulnerability/ |
| 2 | CVE-2020-25720 | 7.5  | HIGH | A vulnerability was found in Samba where a delegated administrator with permission to create objects in Active Directory can write to all attributes of the newly created object, including security-sensitive attributes, even after the object`s creation. This issue occurs because the administrator owns the object due to the lack of an Access Control List (ACL) at the time of creation and later being recognized as the `creator owner.` The retained significant rights of the delegated administrator may not be well understood, potentially leading to unintended privilege escalation or security risks. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-25720<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2305954 |
| 3 | CVE-2023-4639 | 7.4  | HIGH | A flaw was found in Undertow, which incorrectly parses cookies with certain value-delimiting characters in incoming requests. This issue could allow an attacker to construct a cookie value to exfiltrate HttpOnly cookie values or spoof arbitrary additional cookie values, leading to unauthorized data access or modification. The main threat from this flaw impacts data confidentiality and integrity. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1674<br>[2]https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1675<br>[3]https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1676<br>[4]https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1677<br>[5]https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2763<br>[6]https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2764<br>[7]https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3919<br>[8]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-4639<br>[9]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2166022 |
| 4 | CVE-2024-0793 | 7.7  | HIGH | A flaw was found in kube-controller-manager. This issue occurs when the initial application of a HPA config YAML lacking a .spec.behavior.scaleUp block causes a denial of service due to KCM pods going into restart churn. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0741<br>[2]https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1267<br>[3]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-0793<br>[4]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2214402<br>[5]https://github.com/openshift/kubernetes/pull/1876 |
| 5 | CVE-2023-43091 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | A flaw was found in GNOME Maps, which is vulnerable to a code injection attack via its service.json configuration file. If the configuration file is malicious, it may execute arbitrary code. | [1]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2239091<br>[2]https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-maps/-/commit/d26cd774d524404ef7784e6808f551de83de4bea<br>[3]https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-maps/-/issues/588 |
