This vulnerability is fixed in 0.10.4. | [1]https://github.com/projectcapsule/capsule/commit/e1f47feade6e1695b2204407607d07c3b3994f6e<br>[2]https://github.com/projectcapsule/capsule/security/advisories/GHSA-fcpm-6mxq-m5vv |
| 10 | CVE-2025-55282 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | aiven-db-migrate is an Aiven database migration tool. Prior to 1.0.7, there is a privilege escalation vulnerability that allows a user to elevate to superuser inside PostgreSQL databases during a migration from an untrusted source server. By exploiting a lack of search_path restriction, an attacker can override pg_catalog and execute untrusted operators as a superuser. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.7. | [1]https://github.com/aiven/aiven-db-migrate/commit/39517dc55720055d93262033b142a365f5bf92c5<br>[2]https://github.com/aiven/aiven-db-migrate/security/advisories/GHSA-hmvf-93r4-36f9 |
| 11 | CVE-2025-55283 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | aiven-db-migrate is an Aiven database migration tool. Prior to 1.0.7, there is a privilege escalation vulnerability that allows elevation to superuser inside PostgreSQL databases during a migration from an untrusted source server. The vulnerability stems from psql executing commands embedded in a dump from the source server. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.7. | [1]https://github.com/aiven/aiven-db-migrate/commit/36f6c7f7d06216975f625da0a1cb514253c4b3df<br>[2]https://github.com/aiven/aiven-db-migrate/security/advisories/GHSA-wqhc-grmj-fjvg |
| 12 | CVE-2025-55291 | 7.1  | HIGH | Shaarli is a minimalist bookmark manager and link sharing service. Prior to 0.15.0, the input string in the cloud tag page is not properly sanitized. This allows the </title> tag to be prematurely closed, leading to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.15.0. | [1]https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli/commit/66faa61335a6e72184be64092ff1242ffa4fe5b6<br>[2]https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli/security/advisories/GHSA-7w7w-pw4j-265h |
| 13 | CVE-2025-55293 | 9.4  | CRITICAL | Meshtastic is an open source mesh networking solution. Prior to v2.6.3, an attacker can send NodeInfo with a empty publicKey first, then overwrite it with a new key. First sending a empty key bypasses `if (p.public_key.size > 0) {`, clearing the existing publicKey (and resetting the size to 0) for a known node. Then a new key bypasses `if (info->user.public_key.size > 0) {`, and this malicious key is stored in NodeDB. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.6.3. | [1]https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/commit/cf7f0f9d0895602df3453a4f5cfea843f4e09744<br>[2]https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/pull/6372<br>[3]https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/security/advisories/GHSA-95pq-gj5v-4fg2 |
| 14 | CVE-2025-55299 | 9.4  | CRITICAL | VaulTLS is a modern solution for managing mTLS (mutual TLS) certificates. Prior to 0.9.1, user accounts created through the User web UI have an empty but not NULL password set, attackers can use this to login with an empty password. This is combined with that fact, that previously disabling the password based login only effected the frontend, but still allowed login via the API. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.9.1. | [1]https://github.com/7ritn/VaulTLS/commit/6ac0a43a768f1753f6889ba43f914e773a4b45c0<br>[2]https://github.com/7ritn/VaulTLS/security/advisories/GHSA-pjfr-pj3h-cw8m |

| 16 | CVE-2025-53192 | 8.8  | HIGH | ** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Improper Neutralization of Expression/Command Delimiters vulnerability in Apache Commons OGNL.This issue affects Apache Commons OGNL: all versions.When using the API Ognl.getValueâ€‹, the OGNL engine parses and evaluates the provided expression with powerful capabilities, including accessing and invoking related methods, etc. Although OgnlRuntime attempts to restrict certain dangerous classes and methods (such as java.lang.Runtime) through a blocklist, these restrictions are not comprehensive. Attackers may be able to bypass the restrictions by leveraging class objects that are not covered by the blocklist and potentially achieve arbitrary code execution.As this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. | [1]https://lists.apache.org/thread/2gj8tjl6vz949nnp3yxz3okm9xz2k7sp |
