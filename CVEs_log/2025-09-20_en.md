| 3 | CVE-2025-10456 | 7.1  | HIGH | A vulnerability was identified in the handling of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) fixed channels (such as SMP or ATT). Specifically, an attacker could exploit a flaw that causes the BLE target (i.e., the device under attack) to attempt to disconnect a fixed channel, which is not allowed per the Bluetooth specification. This leads to undefined behavior, including potential assertion failures, crashes, or memory corruption, depending on the BLE stack implementation. | [1]https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/security/advisories/GHSA-hcc8-3qr7-c9m8 |
| 4 | CVE-2025-10458 | 7.6  | HIGH | Parameters are not validated or sanitized, and are later used in various internal operations. | [1]https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/security/advisories/GHSA-vmww-237q-2fwp |
| 5 | CVE-2025-5948 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Service Finder Bookings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 6.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user`s identity prior to claiming a business when using the claim_business AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to login as any user including admins. Please note that subscriber privileges or brute-forcing are needed when completing the business takeover. The claim_id is needed to takeover the admin account, but brute-forcing is a practical approach to obtaining valid IDs. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/service-finder-service-and-business-listing-wordpress-theme/15208793<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/7eb018bc-2650-4e0d-8da9-325eac826d45?source=cve |

| 12 | CVE-2025-57528 | 7.7  | HIGH | An issue was discovered in Tenda AC6 US_AC6V1.0BR_V15.03.05.16_multi_TD01 allowing attackers to cause a denial of service via the funcname, funcpara1, funcpara2 parameters to the formSetCfm function (uri path: SetCfm). | [1]https://github.com/faqiadegege/IoTVuln/blob/main/tendaAc6_formSetCfm_funcname_overflow/detail.md |
| 13 | CVE-2025-57644 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | Accela Automation Platform 22.2.3.0.230103 contains multiple vulnerabilities in the Test Script feature. An authenticated administrative user can execute arbitrary Java code on the server, resulting in remote code execution. In addition, improper input validation allows for arbitrary file write and server-side request forgery (SSRF), enabling interaction with internal or external systems. Successful exploitation can lead to full server compromise, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and further network exploitation. | [1]https://medium.com/@anvarkh/cve-2025-57644-remote-code-execution-ssrf-in-accela-eedc6bc4adfb<br>[2]https://www.accela.com |
| 14 | CVE-2025-59344 | 7.7  | HIGH | AliasVault is a privacy-first password manager with built-in email aliasing. A server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the favicon extraction feature of AliasVault API versions 0.23.0 and lower. The extractor fetches a user-supplied URL, parses the returned HTML, and follows <link rel="icon" href="â€¦">. Although the initial URL is validated to allow only HTTP/HTTPS with default ports, the extractor automatically follows redirects and does not block requests to loopback or internal IP ranges. An authenticated, low-privileged user can exploit this behavior to coerce the backend into making HTTP(S) requests to arbitrary internal hosts and non-default ports. If the target host serves a favicon or any other valid image, the response is returned to the attacker in Base64 form. Even when no data is returned, timing and error behavior can be abused to map internal services. This vulnerability only affects self-hosted AliasVault instances that are reachable from the public internet with public user registration enabled. Private/internal deployments without public sign-ups are not directly exploitable. This issue has been fixed in AliasVault release 0.23.1. | [1]https://github.com/aliasvault/aliasvault/commit/58c39815e4c8bb27a311c3b592d54e157b4e6968<br>[2]https://github.com/aliasvault/aliasvault/pull/1226<br>[3]https://github.com/aliasvault/aliasvault/releases/tag/0.23.1<br>[4]https://github.com/aliasvault/aliasvault/security/advisories/GHSA-f253-f7xc-w7pj |
