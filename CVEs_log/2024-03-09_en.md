| 9 | CVE-2024-1382 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Restaurant Reservations plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.9 via the nd_rst_layout attribute of the nd_rst_search shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary PHP files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where an uploaded PHP file may not be directly accessible. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/nd-restaurant-reservations/trunk/addons/visual/search/index.php#L49<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3045964%40nd-restaurant-reservations%2Ftrunk&old=2980579%40nd-restaurant-reservations%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d51db160-c701-426d-890f-73cc4785cad8?source=cve |
| 10 | CVE-2024-1931 | 7.5  | HIGH | NLnet Labs Unbound version 1.18.0 up to and including version 1.19.1 contain a vulnerability that can cause denial of service by a certain code path that can lead to an infinite loop. Unbound 1.18.0 introduced a feature that removes EDE records from responses with size higher than the client`s advertised buffer size. Before removing all the EDE records however, it would try to see if trimming the extra text fields on those records would result in an acceptable size while still retaining the EDE codes. Due to an unchecked condition, the code that trims the text of the EDE records could loop indefinitely. This happens when Unbound would reply with attached EDE information on a positive reply and the client`s buffer size is smaller than the needed space to include EDE records. The vulnerability can only be triggered when the `ede: yes` option is used; non default configuration. From version 1.19.2 on, the code is fixed to avoid looping indefinitely. | [1]https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/unbound/CVE-2024-1931.txt |

| 16 | CVE-2024-1351 | 8.8  | HIGH | Under certain configurations of --tlsCAFile and tls.CAFile, MongoDB Server may skip peer certificate validation which may result in untrusted connections to succeed. This may effectively reduce the security guarantees provided by TLS and open connections  that should have been closed due to failing certificate validation. This issue affects MongoDB Server v7.0 versions prior to and including 7.0.5, MongoDB Server v6.0 versions prior to and including 6.0.13, MongoDB Server v5.0 versions prior to and including 5.0.24 and MongoDB Server v4.4 versions prior to and including 4.4.28.Required Configuration : A server process will allow incoming connections to skip peer certificate validation if the server process was started with TLS enabled (net.tls.mode set to allowTLS, preferTLS, or requireTLS) and without a net.tls.CAFile configured. | [1]https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-72839<br>[2]https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/4.4/#4.4.29---february-28--2024<br>[3]https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/7.0/#7.0.6---feb-28--2024<br>[4]https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v5.0/release-notes/5.0/#5.0.25---february-28--2024<br>[5]https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v6.0/release-notes/6.0/#6.0.14---feb-28--2024 |
| 17 | CVE-2024-1773 | 8.8  | HIGH | The PDF Invoices and Packing Slips For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.7 via deserialization of untrusted input via the order_id parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/pdf-invoices-and-packing-slips-for-woocommerce/trunk/includes/class-apifw-front-end.php#L94<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3042740/<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/4dc6e879-4ccf-485e-b02d-2b291e67df40?source=cve |
| 18 | CVE-2024-0203 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Digits plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 8.4.1. This is due to missing nonce validation in the `digits_save_settings` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the default role of registered users to elevate user privileges via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. | [1]https://digits.unitedover.com/changelog/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/84f2afb4-f1c6-4313-8958-38f1b5140a67?source=cve |

| 20 | CVE-2024-1986 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Booster Elite for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the wc_add_new_product() function in all versions up to, and including, 7.1.7. This makes it possible for customer-level attackers, and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. This is only exploitable when the user product upload functionality is enabled. | [1]https://booster.io/<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woocommerce-jetpack/trunk/includes/shortcodes/class-wcj-products-add-form-shortcodes.php#L132<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woocommerce-jetpack/trunk/includes/shortcodes/class-wcj-products-add-form-shortcodes.php#L138<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woocommerce-jetpack/trunk/includes/shortcodes/class-wcj-products-add-form-shortcodes.php#L322<br>[5]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woocommerce-jetpack/trunk/includes/shortcodes/class-wcj-products-add-form-shortcodes.php#L333<br>[6]https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-jetpack/<br>[7]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c9c2fb7f-a05b-4852-97eb-7befe880d703?source=cve |
| 21 | CVE-2024-28115 | 8.8  | HIGH | FreeRTOS is a real-time operating system for microcontrollers.
