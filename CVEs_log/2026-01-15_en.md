| 1 | CVE-2026-22686 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | Enclave is a secure JavaScript sandbox designed for safe AI agent code execution. Prior to 2.7.0, there is a critical sandbox escape vulnerability in enclave-vm that allows untrusted, sandboxed JavaScript code to execute arbitrary code in the host Node.js runtime. When a tool invocation fails, enclave-vm exposes a host-side Error object to sandboxed code. This Error object retains its host realm prototype chain, which can be traversed to reach the host Function constructor. An attacker can intentionally trigger a host error, then climb the prototype chain. Using the host Function constructor, arbitrary JavaScript can be compiled and executed in the host context, fully bypassing the sandbox and granting access to sensitive resources such as process.env, filesystem, and network. This breaks enclave-vm’s core security guarantee of isolating untrusted code. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.7.0. | [1]https://github.com/agentfront/enclave/commit/ed8bc438b2cd6e6f0b5f2de321e5be6f0169b5a1<br>[2]https://github.com/agentfront/enclave/security/advisories/GHSA-7qm7-455j-5p63 |

| 12 | CVE-2025-14301 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Integration Opvius AI for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Path Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.0. This is due to the `process_table_bulk_actions()` function processing user-supplied file paths without authentication checks, nonce verification, or path validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete or download arbitrary files on the server via the `wsaw-log[]` POST parameter, which can be leveraged to delete critical files like `wp-config.php` or read sensitive configuration files. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woosa-ai-for-woocommerce/tags/1.3.0/vendor/woosa/logger/class-module-logger-hook.php#L160<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woosa-ai-for-woocommerce/tags/1.3.0/vendor/woosa/logger/class-module-logger-hook.php#L25<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woosa-ai-for-woocommerce/tags/1.3.0/vendor/woosa/logger/class-module-logger-hook.php#L41<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woosa-ai-for-woocommerce/tags/1.3.0/vendor/woosa/logger/class-module-logger-hook.php#L79<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/34612902-1a26-4759-bca6-b5aaffa25af4?source=cve |
| 13 | CVE-2025-14502 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The News and Blog Designer Bundle plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.1 via the template parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary .php files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where .php file types can be uploaded and included. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/news-and-blog-designer-bundle/trunk/includes/class-nbdb-ajax.php#L31<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e02683dc-0771-4bd5-bba3-2b5423da1c80?source=cve |
| 14 | CVE-2025-14613 | 7.2  | HIGH | The GetContentFromURL plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to the plugin using wp_remote_get() instead of wp_safe_remote_get() to fetch content from a user-supplied URL in the `url` parameter of the [gcfu] shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and modify information from internal services. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/getcontentfromurl/tags/1.0/classes/shortcode.class.php#L20<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/getcontentfromurl/trunk/classes/shortcode.class.php#L20<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b83db6c7-09af-4707-a96b-ee551f27e3b7?source=cve |
| 15 | CVE-2025-14615 | 7.1  | HIGH | The DASHBOARD BUILDER – WordPress plugin for Charts and Graphs plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.7. This is due to missing nonce validation on the settings handler in dashboardbuilder-admin.php. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the stored SQL query and database credentials used by the [show-dashboardbuilder] shortcode via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The modified SQL query is subsequently executed on the front-end when the shortcode is rendered, enabling arbitrary SQL injection and data exfiltration through the publicly visible chart output. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/dashboard-builder/tags/1.5.7/dashboardbuilder-admin.php#L158<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/dashboard-builder/tags/1.5.7/dashboardbuilder.php#L51<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/dashboard-builder/trunk/dashboardbuilder-admin.php#L158<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/dashboard-builder/trunk/dashboardbuilder.php#L51<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/106b31ed-d509-4551-a134-02193ab22fe1?source=cve |

| 19 | CVE-2025-14770 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Shipping Rate By Cities plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the `city` parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/shipping-rate-by-cities/trunk/shiprate-cities-method-class.php#L372<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/11e7e798-9fb9-4cff-a96f-a0003f203f5f?source=cve |
