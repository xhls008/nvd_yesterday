| 1 | CVE-2026-0712 | 7.6  | HIGH | An open redirect vulnerability has been identified in Grafana OSS that can be exploited to achieve XSS attacks. The vulnerability was introduced in Grafana v11.5.0. The open redirect can be chained with path traversal vulnerabilities to achieve XSS. Fixed in versions 12.0.2+security-01, 11.6.3+security-01, 11.5.6+security-01, 11.4.6+security-01 and 11.3.8+security-01 | [1]https://sick.com/psirt<br>[2]https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices<br>[3]https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1<br>[4]https://www.sick.com/.well-known/csaf/white/2026/sca-2026-0002.json<br>[5]https://www.sick.com/.well-known/csaf/white/2026/sca-2026-0002.pdf<br>[6]https://www.sick.com/media/docs/9/19/719/special_information_sick_operating_guidelines_cybersecurity_by_sick_en_im0106719.pdf |
| 2 | CVE-2026-0713 | 8.3  | HIGH | A security vulnerability in the /apis/dashboard.grafana.app/* endpoints allows authenticated users to bypass dashboard and folder permissions. The vulnerability affects all API versions (v0alpha1, v1alpha1, v2alpha1). Impact: - Viewers can view all dashboards/folders regardless of permissions - Editors can view/edit/delete all dashboards/folders regardless of permissions - Editors can create dashboards in any folder regardless of permissions - Anonymous users with viewer/editor roles are similarly affected Organization isolation boundaries remain intact. The vulnerability only affects dashboard access and does not grant access to datasources. | [1]https://sick.com/psirt<br>[2]https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices<br>[3]https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1<br>[4]https://www.sick.com/.well-known/csaf/white/2026/sca-2026-0002.json<br>[5]https://www.sick.com/.well-known/csaf/white/2026/sca-2026-0002.pdf<br>[6]https://www.sick.com/media/docs/9/19/719/special_information_sick_operating_guidelines_cybersecurity_by_sick_en_im0106719.pdf |

| 7 | CVE-2025-13062 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Supreme Modules Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file upload in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.62. This is due to insufficient file type validation detecting JSON files, allowing double extension files to bypass sanitization while being accepted as a valid JSON file. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3423427/supreme-modules-for-divi<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/1819f2eb-51ef-4ba4-9137-ab64710fa6c8?source=cve |
| 8 | CVE-2026-22638 | 8.3  | HIGH | A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Grafana caused by combining a client path traversal and open redirect. This allows attackers to redirect users to a website that hosts a frontend plugin that will execute arbitrary JavaScript. This vulnerability does not require editor permissions and if anonymous access is enabled, the XSS will work. If the Grafana Image Renderer plugin is installed, it is possible to exploit the open redirect to achieve a full read SSRF. The default Content-Security-Policy (CSP) in Grafana will block the XSS though the `connect-src` directive. | [1]https://sick.com/psirt<br>[2]https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices<br>[3]https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1<br>[4]https://www.sick.com/.well-known/csaf/white/2026/sca-2026-0002.json<br>[5]https://www.sick.com/.well-known/csaf/white/2026/sca-2026-0002.pdf<br>[6]https://www.sick.com/media/docs/9/19/719/special_information_sick_operating_guidelines_cybersecurity_by_sick_en_im0106719.pdf |

| 37 | CVE-2025-67246 | 7.3  | HIGH | A local information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Ludashi driver before 5.1025 due to a lack of access control in the IOCTL handler. This driver exposes a device interface accessible to a normal user and handles attacker-controlled structures containing the lower 4GB of physical addresses. The handler maps arbitrary physical memory via MmMapIoSpace and copies data back to user mode without verifying the caller`s privileges or the target address range. This allows unprivileged users to read arbitrary physical memory, potentially exposing kernel data structures, kernel pointers, security tokens, and other sensitive information. This vulnerability can be further exploited to bypass the Kernel Address Space Layout Rules (KASLR) and achieve local privilege escalation. | [1]http://ludashi.com<br>[2]https://github.com/CDipper/CVE-Publication |

| 39 | CVE-2025-66292 | 8.1  | HIGH | DPanel is an open source server management panel written in Go. Prior to 1.9.2, DPanel has an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability in the /api/common/attach/delete interface. Authenticated users can delete arbitrary files on the server via path traversal. When a user logs into the administrative backend, this interface can be used to delete files. The vulnerability lies in the Delete function within the app/common/http/controller/attach.go file. The path parameter submitted by the user is directly passed to storage.Local{}.GetSaveRealPath and subsequently to os.Remove without proper sanitization or checking for path traversal characters (../). And the helper function in common/service/storage/local.go uses filepath.Join, which resolves ../ but does not enforce a chroot/jail. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.9.2. | [1]https://github.com/donknap/dpanel/commit/cbda0d90204e8212f2010774345c952e42069119<br>[2]https://github.com/donknap/dpanel/releases/tag/v1.9.2<br>[3]https://github.com/donknap/dpanel/security/advisories/GHSA-vh2x-fw87-4fxq |

| 54 | CVE-2026-23520 | 9.0  | CRITICAL | Arcane provides modern docker management. Prior to 1.13.0, Arcane has a command injection in the updater service. Arcane’s updater service supported lifecycle labels com.getarcaneapp.arcane.lifecycle.pre-update and com.getarcaneapp.arcane.lifecycle.post-update that allowed defining a command to run before or after a container update. The label value is passed directly to /bin/sh -c without sanitization or validation. Because any authenticated user (not limited to administrators) can create projects through the API, an attacker can create a project that specifies one of these lifecycle labels with a malicious command. When an administrator later triggers a container update (either manually or via scheduled update checks), Arcane reads the lifecycle label and executes its value as a shell command inside the container.

| 56 | CVE-2025-59960 | 7.4  | HIGH | An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Juniper DHCP service (jdhcpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a DHCP client in one subnet to exhaust the address pools of other subnets, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) on the downstream DHCP server.By default, the DHCP relay agent inserts its own Option 82 information when forwarding client requests, optionally replacing any Option 82 information provided by the client. When a specific DHCP DISCOVER is received in `forward-only` mode with Option 82, the device should drop the message unless `trust-option82` is configured.

A pointer is freed but was then referenced later in the same code path. Successful exploitation is outside the attacker`s direct control due to the specific timing of the two events required to execute the vulnerable code path.This issue affects systems with 802.1X authentication port-based network access control (PNAC) enabled.This issue affects:Junos OS:   *  from 23.2R2-S1 before 23.2R2-S5,   *  from 23.4R2 before 23.4R2-S6,   *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2-S3,   *  from 24.4 before 24.4R2-S1,   *  from 25.2 before 25.2R1-S2, 25.2R2; Junos OS Evolved:   *  from 23.2R2-S1 before 23.2R2-S5-EVO,   *  from 23.4R2 before 23.4R2-S6-EVO,   *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2-S3-EVO,   *  from 24.4 before 24.4R2-S1-EVO,   *  from 25.2 before 25.2R1-S2-EVO, 25.2R2-EVO. | [1]https://kb.juniper.net/JSA106007<br>[2]https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA106007 |
