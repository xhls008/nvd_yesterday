|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2024-8922 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Product Enquiry for WooCommerce, WooCommerce product catalog plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.33.32 via deserialization of untrusted input in enquiry_detail.php. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3155863/enquiry-quotation-for-woocommerce<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/9a485314-cd68-400c-b398-2f8529c6a3ab?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2024-9130 | 7.2  | HIGH | The GiveWP – Donation Plugin and Fundraising Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the ‘order’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.16.1 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with GiveWP Manager-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries within the Legacy View mode, that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://givewp.com/documentation/core/give-user-roles/<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/give/tags/3.16.1/includes/donors/class-give-donors-query.php#L453<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3157829/<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3157829/give/trunk/includes/donors/class-give-donors-query.php<br>[5]https://wordpress.org/plugins/give/#developers<br>[6]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/4a3cae01-620d-405e-baf6-2d66a5b429b3?source=cve |

| 6 | CVE-2024-6931 | 7.2  | HIGH | The The Events Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via RSVP name field in all versions up to, and including, 6.6.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3150170/<br>[2]https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/#developers<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/a5f847d8-323f-47f9-ba10-df8173ff3018?source=cve |

| 16 | CVE-2024-47070 | 9.0  | CRITICAL | authentik is an open-source identity provider. A vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 allows bypassing password login by adding X-Forwarded-For header with an unparsable IP address, e.g. `a`. This results in a possibility of logging into any account with a known login or email address. The vulnerability requires the authentik instance to trust X-Forwarded-For header provided by the attacker, thus it is not reproducible from external hosts on a properly configured environment.  The issue occurs due to the password stage having a policy bound to it, which skips the password stage if the Identification stage is setup to also contain a password stage. Due to the invalid X-Forwarded-For header, which does not get validated to be an IP Address early enough, the exception happens later and the policy fails. The default blueprint doesn`t correctly set `failure_result` to `True` on the policy binding meaning that due to this exception the policy returns false and the password stage is skipped. Versions 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 fix this issue. | [1]https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/commit/78f7b04d5a62b2a9d4316282a713c2c7857dbe29<br>[2]https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/commit/dd8f809161e738b25765797eb2a5c77a7d3fc2cf<br>[3]https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/security/advisories/GHSA-7jxf-mmg9-9hg7 |
| 17 | CVE-2024-46366 | 8.8  | HIGH | A Client-side Template Injection (CSTI) vulnerability in Webkul Krayin CRM 1.3.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary client-side template code by injecting a malicious payload during the lead creation process.
