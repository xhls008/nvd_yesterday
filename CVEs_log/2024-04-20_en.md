| 1 | CVE-2024-3600 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Poll Maker â€“ Best WordPress Poll Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to a missing capability check on the ays_poll_maker_quick_start AJAX action in addition to insufficient escaping and sanitization in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.8. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create quizzes and inject malicious web scripts into them that execute when a user visits the page. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3071296%40poll-maker&new=3071296%40poll-maker&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/fec015e1-7f64-4917-a242-90bd1135f680?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2024-29957 | 7.5  | HIGH | When Brocade SANnav before v2.3.1 and v2.3.0a servers are configured in Disaster Recovery mode, the encryption key is stored in the DR log files. This could provide attackers with an additional, less-protected path to acquiring the encryption key. | [1]https://support.broadcom.com/external/content/SecurityAdvisories/0/23241 |
| 3 | CVE-2024-29958 | 7.5  | HIGH | A vulnerability in Brocade SANnav before v2.3.1 and v2.3.0a prints the encryption key in the console when a privileged user executes the script to replace the Brocade SANnav Management Portal standby node. This could provide attackers an additional, less protected path to acquiring the encryption key. | [1]https://support.broadcom.com/external/content/SecurityAdvisories/0/23242 |
| 4 | CVE-2024-29959 | 8.6  | HIGH | A vulnerability in Brocade SANnav before v2.3.1 and v2.3.0a prints Brocade Fabric OS switch encrypted passwords in the Brocade SANnav Standby node`s support save. | [1]https://support.broadcom.com/external/content/SecurityAdvisories/0/23243 |
| 5 | CVE-2024-29960 | 7.5  | HIGH | In the Brocade SANnav server versions before v2.3.1 and v2.3.0a, the SSH keys inside the OVA image are hardcoded and identical in the VM every time SANnav is installed.

| 12 | CVE-2023-50260 | 8.8  | HIGH | Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. A wrong validation in the `host_deny` script allows to write any string in the `hosts.deny` file, which can end in an arbitrary command execution on the target system. This vulnerability is part of the active response feature, which can automatically triggers actions in response to alerts. By default, active responses are limited to a set of pre defined executables. This is enforced by only allowing executables stored under `/var/ossec/active-response/bin` to be run as an active response. However, the `/var/ossec/active-response/bin/host_deny` can be exploited. `host_deny` is used to add IP address to the `/etc/hosts.deny` file to block incoming connections on a service level by using TCP wrappers. Attacker can inject arbitrary command into the `/etc/hosts.deny` file and execute arbitrary command by using the spawn directive. The active response can be triggered by writing events either to the local `execd` queue on server or to the `ar` queue which forwards the events to agents. So, it can leads to LPE on server as root and RCE on agent as root. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.7.2. | [1]https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/security/advisories/GHSA-mjq2-xf8g-68vw |
| 13 | CVE-2024-32038 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. There is a buffer overflow hazard in wazuh-analysisd when handling Unicode characters from Windows Eventchannel messages. It impacts Wazuh Manager 3.8.0 and above. This vulnerability is fixed in Wazuh Manager 4.7.2. | [1]https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/security/advisories/GHSA-fcpw-v3pg-c327 |
| 14 | CVE-2024-32644 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | Evmos is a scalable, high-throughput Proof-of-Stake EVM blockchain that is fully compatible and interoperable with Ethereum. Prior to 17.0.0, there is a way to mint arbitrary tokens due to the possibility to have two different states not in sync during the execution of a transaction. The exploit is based on the fact that to sync the Cosmos SDK state and the EVM one, we rely on the `stateDB.Commit()` method. When we call this method, we iterate though all the `dirtyStorage` and, **if and only if** it is different than the `originStorage`, we set the new state. Setting the new state means we update the Cosmos SDK KVStore.  If a contract storage state that is the same before and after a transaction, but is changed during the transaction and can call an external contract after the change, it can be exploited to make the transaction similar to non-atomic. The vulnerability is **critical** since this could lead to drain of funds through creative SC interactions.  The issue has been patched in versions >=V17.0.0. | [1]https://github.com/evmos/evmos/blob/b196a522ba4951890b40992e9f97aa610f8b5f9c/x/evm/statedb/statedb.go#L460-L465<br>[2]https://github.com/evmos/evmos/commit/08982b5ee726b97bc50eaf58d1914829648b6a5f<br>[3]https://github.com/evmos/evmos/security/advisories/GHSA-3fp5-2xwh-fxm6 |
