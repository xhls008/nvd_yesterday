| 1 | CVE-2025-1021 | 7.5  | HIGH | Missing authorization vulnerability in synocopy in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 7.1.1-42962-8, 7.2.1-69057-7 and 7.2.2-72806-3 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via unspecified vectors. | [1]https://www.synology.com/en-global/security/advisory/Synology_SA_25_03 |
| 2 | CVE-2025-3529 | 8.2  | HIGH | The WordPress Simple Shopping Cart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.2 via the `file_url` parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view potentially sensitive information and download a digital product without paying for it. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wordpress-simple-paypal-shopping-cart/tags/5.1.2/includes/wpsc-shortcodes-related.php#L92<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3275373/<br>[3]https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-simple-paypal-shopping-cart/#developers<br>[4]https://www.tipsandtricks-hq.com/ecommerce/wp-simple-cart-sell-digital-downloads-2468<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/8fecc015-518f-4aab-a17e-17cf4b8cf123?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2025-3530 | 7.5  | HIGH | The WordPress Simple Shopping Cart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to product price manipulation in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.2. This is due to a logic flaw involving the inconsistent use of parameters during the cart addition process. The plugin uses the parameter `product_tmp_two` for computing a security hash against price tampering while using `wspsc_product` to display the product, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to substitute details from a cheaper product and bypass payment for a more expensive item. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wordpress-simple-paypal-shopping-cart/tags/5.1.2/wp_shopping_cart.php#L156<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wordpress-simple-paypal-shopping-cart/tags/5.1.2/wp_shopping_cart.php#L165<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wordpress-simple-paypal-shopping-cart/tags/5.1.2/wp_shopping_cart.php#L171<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wordpress-simple-paypal-shopping-cart/tags/5.1.2/wp_shopping_cart.php#L261<br>[5]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3275373/<br>[6]https://www.tipsandtricks-hq.com/wordpress-simple-paypal-shopping-cart-plugin-768<br>[7]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e0a3910b-adc4-4633-a6a1-32ba50894be4?source=cve |

| 6 | CVE-2025-21605 | 7.5  | HIGH | Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In versions starting at 2.6 and prior to 7.4.3, An unauthenticated client can cause unlimited growth of output buffers, until the server runs out of memory or is killed. By default, the Redis configuration does not limit the output buffer of normal clients (see client-output-buffer-limit). Therefore, the output buffer can grow unlimitedly over time. As a result, the service is exhausted and the memory is unavailable. When password authentication is enabled on the Redis server, but no password is provided, the client can still cause the output buffer to grow from "NOAUTH" responses until the system will run out of memory. This issue has been patched in version 7.4.3. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable is to block access to prevent unauthenticated users from connecting to Redis. This can be done in different ways. Either using network access control tools like firewalls, iptables, security groups, etc, or enabling TLS and requiring users to authenticate using client side certificates. | [1]https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/7.4.3<br>[2]https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-r67f-p999-2gff |
