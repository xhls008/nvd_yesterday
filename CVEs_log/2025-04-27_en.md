|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2025-2801 | 7.3  | HIGH | The The Create custom forms for WordPress with a smart form plugin for smart businesses plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.4. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/abcsubmit/tags/1.2.4/abcsubmit.php#L86<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/abcsubmit/tags/1.2.4/abcsubmit.php#L88<br>[3]https://wordpress.org/plugins/abcsubmit/#developers<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e45afda4-447a-4d95-90cb-9731b398a009?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2024-13808 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Xpro Elementor Addons - Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.9 via the custom PHP widget. This is due to their only being client side controls when determining who can access the widget. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to execute code on the server. | [1]https://elementor.wpxpro.com<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0833e55f-22aa-44c9-aff6-1f3b74016e4c?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2025-2105 | 8.1  | HIGH | The Jupiter X Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 4.8.11 via deserialization of untrusted input from the `file` parameter of the `raven_download_file` function. This makes it possible for attackers to inject a PHP Object through a PHAR file. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present. This vulnerability may be exploited by unauthenticated attackers when a form is present on the site with the file download action, and the ability to upload files is also present. Otherwise, this would be considered exploitable by Contributor-level users and above, because they could create the form needed to successfully exploit this. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3279676/jupiterx-core/trunk/includes/extensions/raven/includes/utils.php<br>[2]https://wordpress.org/plugins/jupiterx-core/<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/3427387e-30d2-40a5-9bfd-d458039d8e2e?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2025-3491 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Add custom page template plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Code Injection leading to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.1 via the `acpt_validate_setting` function. This is due to insufficient sanitization of the `template_name` parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to execute code on the server. | [1]https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/add-custom-page-template/trunk/index.php<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/9c2d97c4-b166-4d1f-8042-d0362e650c62?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2025-3906 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Integração entre Eduzz e Woocommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the `wep_opcoes` function in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to edit the default registration role within the plugin`s registration flow to Administrator, which allows any user to create an Administrator account. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/integracao-entre-eduzz-e-wc-powers/trunk/admin/class-wep-admin.php#L120<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/integracao-entre-eduzz-e-wc-powers/trunk/include/class-wep-webhook.php#L7<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/integracao-entre-eduzz-e-wc-powers/trunk/wep-powers.php#L19<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/eb85ed32-c391-45d2-9e86-cb97009210cd?source=cve |
| 6 | CVE-2025-3914 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Aeropage Sync for Airtable plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the `aeropage_media_downloader` function in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/aeropage-sync-for-airtable/trunk/aeropage.php#L1214<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/aeropage-sync-for-airtable/trunk/aeropage.php#L1215<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/aeropage-sync-for-airtable/trunk/aeropage.php#L1250<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3281904/<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/a501c2d6-cdcc-4003-99df-245f5253e20f?source=cve |
