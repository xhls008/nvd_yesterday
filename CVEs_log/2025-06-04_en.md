| 18 | CVE-2024-36486 | 7.8  | HIGH | A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the virtual machine archive restoration functionality of Parallels Desktop for Mac version 20.1.1 (55740). When an archived virtual machine is restored, the prl_vmarchiver tool decompresses the file and writes the content back to its original location using root privileges. An attacker can exploit this process by using a hard link to write to an arbitrary file, potentially resulting in privilege escalation. | [1]https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-2126<br>[2]https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-2126<br>[3]https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-2126 |
| 19 | CVE-2024-52561 | 7.8  | HIGH | A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Snapshot functionality of Parallels Desktop for Mac version 20.1.1 (build 55740). When a snapshot of a virtual machine is deleted, a root service verifies and modifies the ownership of the snapshot files. By using a symlink, an attacker can change the ownership of files owned by root to a lower-privilege user, potentially leading to privilege escalation. | [1]https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-2123<br>[2]https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-2123<br>[3]https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-2123 |
| 20 | CVE-2024-54189 | 7.8  | HIGH | A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Snapshot functionality of Parallels Desktop for Mac version 20.1.1 (build 55740). When a snapshot of a virtual machine is taken, a root service writes to a file owned by a normal user. By using a hard link, an attacker can write to an arbitrary file, potentially leading to privilege escalation. | [1]https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-2124<br>[2]https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-2124<br>[3]https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-2124 |
| 21 | CVE-2025-31359 | 8.8  | HIGH | A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the PVMP package unpacking functionality of Parallels Desktop for Mac version 20.2.2 (55879).

| 22 | CVE-2025-4392 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Shared Files – Frontend File Upload Form & Secure File Sharing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via html File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.48 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the sanitize_file() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass the plugin’s MIME-only checks and inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the html file. | [1]https://github.com/anssilaitila/shared-files/blob/master/admin/class-sf-admin-allow-more-file-types.php<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3304053/<br>[3]https://wordpress.org/plugins/shared-files/#developers<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/469a9c8a-0708-4c93-99d8-e9157a1f91f5?source=cve |
| 23 | CVE-2025-4138 | 7.5  | HIGH | Allows the extraction filter to be ignored, allowing symlink targets to point outside the destination directory, and the modification of some file metadata.You are affected by this vulnerability if using the tarfile module to extract untrusted tar archives using TarFile.extractall() or TarFile.extract() using the filter= parameter with a value of "data" or "tar". See the tarfile  extraction filters documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile-extraction-filter  for more information. Only Python versions 3.12 or later are affected by these vulnerabilities, earlier versions don`t include the extraction filter feature.Note that for Python 3.14 or later the default value of filter= changed from "no filtering" to `"data", so if you are relying on this new default behavior then your usage is also affected.Note that none of these vulnerabilities significantly affect the installation of source distributions which are tar archives as source distributions already allow arbitrary code execution during the build process. However when evaluating source distributions it`s important to avoid installing source distributions with suspicious links. | [1]https://gist.github.com/sethmlarson/52398e33eff261329a0180ac1d54f42f<br>[2]https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/19de092debb3d7e832e5672cc2f7b788d35951da<br>[3]https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/28463dba112af719df1e8b0391c46787ad756dd9<br>[4]https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/3612d8f51741b11f36f8fb0494d79086bac9390a<br>[5]https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/4633f3f497b1ff70e4a35b6fe2c907cbe2d4cb2e<br>[6]https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/9c1110ef6652687d7c55f590f909720eddde965a<br>[7]https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/9e0ac76d96cf80b49055f6d6b9a6763fb9215c2a<br>[8]https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/aa9eb5f757ceff461e6e996f12c89e5d9b583b01<br>[9]https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/dd8f187d0746da151e0025c51680979ac5b4cfb1<br>[10]https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/135034<br>[11]https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/135037<br>[12]https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/thread/MAXIJJCUUMCL7ATZNDVEGGHUMQMUUKLG/ |

| 38 | CVE-2025-30167 | 7.3  | HIGH | Jupyter Core is a package for the core common functionality of Jupyter projects. When using Jupyter Core prior to version 5.8.0 on Windows, the shared `%PROGRAMDATA%` directory is searched for configuration files (`SYSTEM_CONFIG_PATH` and `SYSTEM_JUPYTER_PATH`), which may allow users to create configuration files affecting other users. Only shared Windows systems with multiple users and unprotected `%PROGRAMDATA%` are affected. Users should upgrade to Jupyter Core version 5.8.0 or later to receive a patch. Some other mitigations are available.

| 44 | CVE-2025-35036 | 7.3  | HIGH | Hibernate Validator before 6.2.0 and 7.0.0, by default and depending how it is used, may interpolate user-supplied input in a constraint violation message with Expression Language. This could allow an attacker to access sensitive information or execute arbitrary Java code. Hibernate Validator as of 6.2.0 and 7.0.0 no longer interpolates custom constraint violation messages with Expression Language and strongly recommends not allowing user-supplied input in constraint violation messages. CVE-2020-5245 and CVE-2025-4428 are examples of related, downstream vulnerabilities involving Expression Language intepolation of user-supplied data. | [1]https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/reference/en-US/html_single/#section-hibernateconstraintvalidatorcontext<br>[2]https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator/commit/05f795bb7cf18856004f40e5042709e550ed0d6e<br>[3]https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator/commit/254858d9dcc4e7cd775d1b0f47f482218077c5e1<br>[4]https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator/commit/d2db40b9e7d22c7a0b44d7665242dfc7b4d14d78<br>[5]https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator/commit/e076293b0ee1bfa97b6e67d05ad9eee1ad77e893<br>[6]https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator/compare/6.1.7.Final...6.2.0.Final<br>[7]https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator/pull/1138<br>[8]https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HV-1816<br>[9]https://hibernate.org/validator/documentation/migration-guide/#6-2-0-cr1<br>[10]https://in.relation.to/2021/01/06/hibernate-validator-700-62-final-released/#expression-language<br>[11]https://labs.watchtowr.com/expression-payloads-meet-mayhem-cve-2025-4427-and-cve-2025-4428/<br>[12]https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-5245<br>[13]https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4428 |
