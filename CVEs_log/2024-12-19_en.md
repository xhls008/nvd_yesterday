This vulnerability affects DAQExpress 5.1 and prior versions.  Please note that DAQExpress is an EOL product and will not receive any updates. | [1]https://knowledge.ni.com/KnowledgeArticleDetails?id=kA00Z000000kFD7SAM&l=en-US |
| 53 | CVE-2024-49363 | 7.4  | HIGH | Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. In affected versions FileServerService (media proxy) in github.com/misskey-dev/misskey 2024.10.1 or earlier did not detect proxy loops, which allows remote actors to execute a self-propagating reflected/amplified distributed denial-of-service via a maliciously crafted note. FileServerService.prototype.proxyHandler did not check incoming requests are not coming from another proxy server. An attacker can execute an amplified denial-of-service by sending a nested proxy request to the server and end the request with a malicious redirect back to another nested proxy request.Leading to unbounded recursion until the original request is timed out. This issue has been addressed in version 2024.11.0-alpha.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may configure the reverse proxy to block requests to the proxy with an empty User-Agent header or one containing Misskey/. An attacker can not effectively modify the User-Agent header without making another request to the server. | [1]https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-gq5q-c77c-v236 |
| 54 | CVE-2024-53270 | 7.5  | HIGH | Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In affected versions `sendOverloadError` is going to assume the active request exists when `envoy.load_shed_points.http1_server_abort_dispatch` is configured. If `active_request` is nullptr, only onMessageBeginImpl() is called. However, the `onMessageBeginImpl` will directly return ok status if the stream is already reset leading to the nullptr reference. The downstream reset can actually happen during the H/2 upstream reset. As a result envoy may crash. This issue has been addressed in releases 1.32.3, 1.31.5, 1.30.9, and 1.29.12. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable `http1_server_abort_dispatch` load shed point and/or use a high threshold. | [1]https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/37743/commits/6cf8afda956ba67c9afad185b962325a5242ef02<br>[2]https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-q9qv-8j52-77p3<br>[3]https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-q9qv-8j52-77p3 |
| 55 | CVE-2024-53271 | 7.1  | HIGH | Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In affected versions envoy  does not properly handle http 1.1 non-101 1xx responses. This can lead to downstream failures in networked devices. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.31.5 and 1.32.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. | [1]https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/da56f6da63079baecef9183436ee5f4141a59af8<br>[2]https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-rmm5-h2wv-mg4f<br>[3]https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-rmm5-h2wv-mg4f |
