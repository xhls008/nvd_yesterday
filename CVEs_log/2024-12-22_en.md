| 1 | CVE-2023-31279 | 8.1  | HIGH | The AirVantage platform is vulnerable to an unauthorized attacker registering previously unregistered devices on the AirVantage platform when the owner has not disabled the AirVantage Management Service on the devices or registered the device.

| 2 | CVE-2024-11349 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The AdForest theme for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.6. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user`s identity prior to authenticating them through the sb_login_user_with_otp_fun() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as arbitrary users, including administrators. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/adforest-classified-wordpress-theme/19481695<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/f374b3d1-820b-473f-8d2b-c3267e6d23d9?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2024-11977 | 7.3  | HIGH | The The kk Star Ratings – Rate Post & Collect User Feedbacks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 5.4.10. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/kk-star-ratings/tags/5.4.9/src/core/wp/actions/wp_ajax_kk-star-ratings.php#L84<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/5dea49fb-2703-4754-9abd-5f4e526d5570?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2024-12066 | 8.8  | HIGH | The SMSA Shipping(official) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the smsa_delete_label() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/smsa-shipping-official/trunk/smsa-express-shipping.php#L235<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/29d72347-ba49-45c6-a964-2c75064ac866?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2024-12721 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Custom Product Tabs For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.4 via deserialization of untrusted input from the `wb_custom_tabs` parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Shop Manager-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wb-custom-product-tabs-for-woocommerce/trunk/includes/class-wb-custom-product-tabs-for-woocommerce.php#L366<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/3fdc6a04-ef39-498a-b739-f40d5d8af47e?source=cve |
| 6 | CVE-2024-12771 | 8.8  | HIGH | The eCommerce Product Catalog Plugin for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.43. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the `customer_panel_password_reset` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the password of any administrator or customer account via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ecommerce-product-catalog/trunk/modules/cart/includes/customers/includes/transactions/customer-panel.php#L108<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ecommerce-product-catalog/trunk/modules/cart/includes/customers/includes/transactions/customer-panel.php#L44<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3210939/<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/3513ec24-0b1b-4528-9f89-eee5654e4e98?source=cve |
