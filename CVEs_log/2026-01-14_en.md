| 121 | CVE-2025-68271 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | OpenC3 COSMOS provides the functionality needed to send commands to and receive data from one or more embedded systems. From 5.0.0 to 6.10.1, OpenC3 COSMOS contains a critical remote code execution vulnerability reachable through the JSON-RPC API. When a JSON-RPC request uses the string form of certain APIs, attacker-controlled parameter text is parsed into values using String#convert_to_value. For array-like inputs, convert_to_value executes eval(). Because the cmd code path parses the command string before calling authorize(), an unauthenticated attacker can trigger Ruby code execution even though the request ultimately fails authorization (401). This vulnerability is fixed in 6.10.2. | [1]https://github.com/OpenC3/cosmos/security/advisories/GHSA-w757-4qv9-mghp |

| 147 | CVE-2026-22817 | 8.2  | HIGH | Hono is a Web application framework that provides support for any JavaScript runtime. Prior to 4.11.4, there is a flaw in Hono’s JWK/JWKS JWT verification middleware allowed the JWT header’s alg value to influence signature verification when the selected JWK did not explicitly specify an algorithm. This could enable JWT algorithm confusion and, in certain configurations, allow forged tokens to be accepted. As part of this fix, the JWT middleware now requires the alg option to be explicitly specified. This prevents algorithm confusion by ensuring that the verification algorithm is not derived from untrusted JWT header values. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.11.4. | [1]https://github.com/honojs/hono/commit/cc0aa7ae327ed84cc391d29086dec2a3e44e7a1f<br>[2]https://github.com/honojs/hono/security/advisories/GHSA-f67f-6cw9-8mq4 |
