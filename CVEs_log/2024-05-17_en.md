|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2023-5935 | 7.4  | HIGH | When configuring Arc (e.g. during the first setup), a local web interface is provided to ease the configuration process. Such web interface lacks authentication and may thus be abused by a local attacker or malware running on the machine itself.A malicious local user or process, during a window of opportunity when the local web interface is active, may be able to extract sensitive information or change Arc`s configuration. This could also lead to arbitrary code execution if a malicious update package is installed. | [1]https://security.nozominetworks.com/NN-2023:13-01 |
| 2 | CVE-2023-5936 | 7.8  | HIGH | On Unix systems (Linux, MacOS), Arc uses a temporary file with unsafe privileges.By tampering with such file, a malicious local user in the system may be able to trigger arbitrary code execution with root privileges. | [1]https://security.nozominetworks.com/NN-2023:14-01 |
| 3 | CVE-2024-3319 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | An issue was identified in the Identity Security Cloud (ISC) Transform preview and IdentityProfile preview API endpoints that allowed an authenticated administrator to execute user-defined templates as part of attribute transforms which could allow remote code execution on the host. | [1]https://www.sailpoint.com/security-advisories/ |
| 4 | CVE-2023-5938 | 8.0  | HIGH | Multiple functions use archives without properly validating the filenames therein, rendering the application vulnerable to path traversal via `zip slip` attacks.An administrator able to provide tampered archives to be processed by the affected versions of Arc may be able to have arbitrary files extracted to arbitrary filesystem locations. Leveraging this issue, an attacker may be able to overwrite arbitrary files on the target filesystem and cause critical impacts on the system (e.g., arbitrary command execution on the victim’s machine). | [1]https://security.nozominetworks.com/NN-2023:16-01 |

| 6 | CVE-2024-34082 | 8.5  | HIGH | Grav is a file-based Web platform. Prior to version 1.7.46, a low privilege user account with page edit privilege can read any server files using Twig Syntax. This includes Grav user account files - `/grav/user/accounts/*.yaml`. This file stores hashed user password, 2FA secret, and the password reset token. This can allow an adversary to compromise any registered account and read any file in the web server by resetting a password for a user to get access to the password reset token from the file or by cracking the hashed password. A low privileged user may also perform a full account takeover of other registered users including Administrators. Version 1.7.46 contains a patch. | [1]https://github.com/getgrav/grav/commit/b6bba9eb99bf8cb55b8fa8d23f18873ca594e348<br>[2]https://github.com/getgrav/grav/security/advisories/GHSA-f8v5-jmfh-pr69 |
