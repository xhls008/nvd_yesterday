| 4 | CVE-2024-46992 | 7.8  | HIGH | Electron is an open source framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. From versions 30.0.0-alpha.1 to before 30.0.5 and 31.0.0-alpha.1 to before 31.0.0-beta.1, Electron is vulnerable to an ASAR Integrity bypass. This only impacts apps that have the embeddedAsarIntegrityValidation and onlyLoadAppFromAsar fuses enabled. Apps without these fuses enabled are not impacted. This issue is specific to Windows, apps using these fuses on macOS are not impacted. Specifically this issue can only be exploited if the app is launched from a filesystem the attacker has write access too. i.e. the ability to edit files inside the .app bundle on macOS which these fuses are supposed to protect against. This issue has been patched in versions 30.0.5 and 31.0.0-beta.1. There are no workarounds for this issue. | [1]https://github.com/electron/electron/security/advisories/GHSA-xw5q-g62x-2qjc<br>[2]https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/fuses |
| 5 | CVE-2025-53095 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | Sunshine is a self-hosted game stream host for Moonlight. Prior to version 2025.628.4510, the web UI of Sunshine lacks protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to craft a malicious web page that, when visited by an authenticated user, can trigger unintended actions within the Sunshine application on behalf of that user. Specifically, since the application does OS command execution by design, this issue can be exploited to abuse the "Command Preparations" feature, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed with Administrator privileges when an application is launched. This issue has been patched in version 2025.628.4510. | [1]https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/commit/738ac93a0ec1cd10412d1f339968775f53bfefe0<br>[2]https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/security/advisories/GHSA-39hj-fxvw-758m |

| 32 | CVE-2025-53107 | 7.5  | HIGH | @cyanheads/git-mcp-server is an MCP server designed to interact with Git repositories. Prior to version 2.1.5, there is a command injection vulnerability caused by the unsanitized use of input parameters within a call to child_process.exec, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the server process`s privileges. The server constructs and executes shell commands using unvalidated user input directly within command-line strings. This introduces the possibility of shell metacharacter injection (|, >, &&, etc.). An MCP Client can be instructed to execute additional actions for example via indirect prompt injection when asked to read git logs. This issue has been patched in version 2.1.5. | [1]https://github.com/cyanheads/git-mcp-server/commit/0dbd6995ccdf76ab770b58013034365b2d06c4d9<br>[2]https://github.com/cyanheads/git-mcp-server/releases/tag/v2.1.5<br>[3]https://github.com/cyanheads/git-mcp-server/security/advisories/GHSA-3q26-f695-pp76 |

| 34 | CVE-2025-53104 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | gluestack-ui is a library of copy-pasteable components & patterns crafted with Tailwind CSS (NativeWind). Prior to commit e6b4271, a command injection vulnerability was discovered in the discussion-to-slack.yml GitHub Actions workflow. Untrusted discussion fields (title, body, etc.) were directly interpolated into shell commands in a run: block. An attacker could craft a malicious GitHub Discussion title or body (e.g., $(curl ...)) to execute arbitrary shell commands on the Actions runner. This issue has been fixed in commit e6b4271 where the discussion-to-slack.yml workflow was removed. Users should remove the discussion-to-slack.yml workflow if using a fork or derivative of this repository. | [1]https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui/commit/e6b427150b35e97a089ea10409de8c5c52f8a7b9<br>[2]https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui/security/advisories/GHSA-432r-9455-7f9x |
