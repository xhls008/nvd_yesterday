| 18 | CVE-2024-32982 | 8.2  | HIGH | Litestar and Starlite is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework. Prior to 2.8.3, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability has been discovered in the static file serving component of LiteStar. This vulnerability allows attackers to exploit path traversal flaws, enabling unauthorized access to sensitive files outside the designated directories. Such access can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information or potentially compromise the server. The vulnerability is located in the file path handling mechanism within the static content serving function, specifically at `litestar/static_files/base.py`. This vulnerability is fixed in versions 2.8.3, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4. | [1]https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar/blob/main/litestar/static_files/base.py#L70<br>[2]https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar/commit/57e706e7effdc182fc9a2af5981bc88afb21851b<br>[3]https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar/security/advisories/GHSA-83pv-qr33-2vcf |
| 19 | CVE-2024-34069 | 7.5  | HIGH | Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. The debugger in affected versions of Werkzeug can allow an attacker to execute code on a developer`s machine under some circumstances. This requires the attacker to get the developer to interact with a domain and subdomain they control, and enter the debugger PIN, but if they are successful it allows access to the debugger even if it is only running on localhost. This also requires the attacker to guess a URL in the developer`s application that will trigger the debugger. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.0.3. | [1]https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/3386395b24c7371db11a5b8eaac0c91da5362692<br>[2]https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/security/advisories/GHSA-2g68-c3qc-8985 |
