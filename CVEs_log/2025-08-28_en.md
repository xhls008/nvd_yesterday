| 20 | CVE-2025-50972 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | SQL Injection vulnerability in AbanteCart 1.4.2, allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the tmpl_id parameter to index.php. Three techniques have been demonstrated: error-based injection using a crafted FLOOR-based payload, time-based blind injection via SLEEP(), and UNION-based injection to extract arbitrary data. | [1]https://github.com/4rdr/proofs/blob/main/info/abantecart_sql_injection_1.4.2_via_template_parameter.md |
| 21 | CVE-2025-50989 | 8.8  | HIGH | OPNsense 25.1 contains an authenticated command injection vulnerability in its Bridge Interface Edit endpoint (interfaces_bridge_edit.php).

| 25 | CVE-2025-50983 | 8.3  | HIGH | SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the sortKey parameter of the GET /api/v1/wanted/cutoff API endpoint in readarr 0.4.15.2787. The endpoint fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing attackers to inject and execute arbitrary SQL commands against the backend SQLite database. Sqlmap confirmed exploitation via stacked queries, demonstrating that the parameter can be abused to run arbitrary SQL statements. A heavy query was executed using SQLite`s RANDOMBLOB() and HEX() functions to simulate a time-based payload, indicating deep control over database interactions. | [1]https://github.com/4rdr/proofs/blob/main/info/readarr-0.4.15.2787-sql-injection-via-sortkey-parameter.md |
| 26 | CVE-2025-50979 | 8.6  | HIGH | NodeBB v4.3.0 is vulnerable to SQL injection in its search-categories API endpoint (/api/v3/search/categories).

| 32 | CVE-2025-55582 | 7.8  | HIGH | D-Link DCS-825L firmware v1.08.01 contains a vulnerability in the watchdog script `mydlink-watch-dog.sh`, which blindly respawns binaries such as `dcp` and `signalc` without verifying integrity, authenticity, or permissions. An attacker with local filesystem access (via physical access, firmware modification, or debug interfaces) can replace these binaries with malicious payloads. The script executes these binaries as root in an infinite loop, leading to persistent privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution. This issue is mitigated in v1.09.02, but the product is officially End-of-Life and unsupported. | [1]https://supportannouncement.us.dlink.com/security/publication.aspx?name=SAP10431<br>[2]https://www.dlink.com/en/security-bulletin/ |
