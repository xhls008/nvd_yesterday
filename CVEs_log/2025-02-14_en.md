| 1 | CVE-2024-7102 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | An issue was discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 16.4 prior to 17.5.0 which allows an attacker to trigger a pipeline as another user under certain circumstances. | [1]https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/474414<br>[2]https://hackerone.com/reports/2623063 |
| 2 | CVE-2025-25286 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Crayfish is a collection of Islandora 8 microservices, one of which, Homarus, provides FFmpeg as a microservice. Prior to Crayfish version 4.1.0, remote code execution may be possible in web-accessible installations of Homarus in certain configurations. The issue has been patched in `islandora/crayfish:4.1.0`. Some workarounds are available. The exploit requires making a request against the Homarus`s `/convert` endpoint; therefore, the ability to exploit is much reduced if the microservice is not directly accessible from the Internet, so: Prevent general access from the Internet from hitting Homarus. Alternatively or additionally, configure auth in Crayfish to be more strongly required, such that requests with `Authorization` headers that do not validate are rejected before the problematic CLI interpolation occurs. | [1]https://github.com/Islandora/Crayfish/commit/64cb4cec688928798cc40e6f0a0e863d7f69fd89<br>[2]https://github.com/Islandora/Crayfish/security/advisories/GHSA-mm6v-68qp-f9fw |
| 3 | CVE-2025-0896 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Orthanc server prior to version 1.5.8 does not enable basic authentication by default when remote access is enabled. This could result in unauthorized access by an attacker. | [1]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-medical-advisories/icsma-25-037-02 |
| 4 | CVE-2024-10763 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Campress theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.35 via the `campress_woocommerce_get_ajax_products` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where php file type can be uploaded and included. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/campress-responsive-education-courses-and-events-wordpress-theme/19355619<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d818b467-a893-4f4f-b623-abff99ef37b4?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2024-13770 | 8.1  | HIGH | The Puzzles | WP Magazine / Review with Store WordPress Theme + RTL theme for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.4 via deserialization of untrusted input `view_more_posts` AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present. The developer opted to remove the software from the repository, so an update is not available and it is recommended to find a replacement software. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/puzzles-wordpress-magazinereview-with-wooc/5690583<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/950d1c8f-6715-4b0d-bf3d-af978a146838?source=cve |

| 17 | CVE-2025-1094 | 8.1  | HIGH | Improper neutralization of quoting syntax in PostgreSQL libpq functions PQescapeLiteral(), PQescapeIdentifier(), PQescapeString(), and PQescapeStringConn() allows a database input provider to achieve SQL injection in certain usage patterns.  Specifically, SQL injection requires the application to use the function result to construct input to psql, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.  Similarly, improper neutralization of quoting syntax in PostgreSQL command line utility programs allows a source of command line arguments to achieve SQL injection when client_encoding is BIG5 and server_encoding is one of EUC_TW or MULE_INTERNAL.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.3, 16.7, 15.11, 14.16, and 13.19 are affected. | [1]https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2025-1094/<br>[2]https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/02/msg00015.html |

| 45 | CVE-2025-24888 | 8.1  | HIGH | The SecureDrop Client is a desktop application for journalists to communicate with sources and work with submissions on the SecureDrop Workstation. Prior to version 0.14.1, a malicious SecureDrop Server could obtain code execution on the SecureDrop Client virtual machine (`sd-app`). SecureDrop Server itself has multiple layers of built-in hardening, and is a dedicated physical machine exposed on the internet only via Tor hidden services for the Source and Journalist interfaces, and optionally via remote SSH access over another Tor hidden service. A newsroom`s SecureDrop Workstation communicates only with its own dedicated SecureDrop Server.The SecureDrop Client runs in a dedicated Qubes virtual machine, named `sd-app`, as part of the SecureDrop Workstation. The private OpenPGP key used to decrypt submissions and replies is stored in a separate virtual machine and never accessed directly. The vulnerability lies in the code responsible for downloading replies. The filename of the reply is obtained from the `Content-Disposition` HTTP header and used to write the encrypted reply on disk. Note that filenames are generated and sanitized server-side, and files are downloaded in an encrypted format, so a remote attacker who has not achieved server compromise, such as one posing as a source, could not craft the HTTP response necessary for this attack.While the filename is later checked to guard against path traversal before being moved into the Client’s data storage directory, the file has already been written to a potentially arbitrary location. In this case, `safe_move()` would detect the path traversal and fail, leaving the original downloaded file in the attacker-chosen directory. Code execution can be gained by writing an autostart file in `/home/user/.config/autostart/`.Version 0.14.1 fixes the issue. As of time of publication, there is no known evidence of exploitation in the wild. This attack requires a previously compromised SecureDrop Server. | [1]https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client/blob/0.14.0/client/securedrop_client/utils.py#L79<br>[2]https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client/blob/main/client/securedrop_client/api_jobs/downloads.py#L164<br>[3]https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client/blob/release/0.14.0/client/securedrop_client/sdk/__init__.py#L956-L957<br>[4]https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client/commit/120bac14649db0bcf5f24f2eb82731c76843b1ba<br>[5]https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client/security/advisories/GHSA-6c3p-chq6-q3j2<br>[6]https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/split-gpg |
