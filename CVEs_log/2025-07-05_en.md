|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2025-5953 | 8.8  | HIGH | The WP Human Resource Management plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to missing authorization in the ajax_insert_employee() and update_empoyee() functions in versions 2.0.0 through 2.2.17. The AJAX handler reads the client-supplied $_POST[`role`] and, after basic cleaning via hrm_clean(), passes it directly to wp_insert_user() and later to $user->set_role() without verifying that the current user is allowed to assign that role. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Employee-level access and above, to elevate their privileges to administrator. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/hrm/tags/2.2.17/class/employee.php#L543<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/hrm/tags/2.2.17/class/employee.php#L591<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/hrm/tags/2.2.17/class/employee.php#L89<br>[4]https://wordpress.org/plugins/hrm/#developers<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/3ba33a18-429f-4a3e-b018-bdfbbe6e8482?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2025-6238 | 8.0  | HIGH | The AI Engine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to open redirect in version 2.8.4. This is due to an insecure OAuth implementation, as the `redirect_uri` parameter is missing validation during the authorization flow. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to intercept the authorization code and obtain an access token by redirecting the user to an attacker-controlled URI. Note: OAuth is disabled, the `Meow_MWAI_Labs_OAuth` class is not loaded in the plugin in the patched version 2.8.5. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ai-engine/tags/2.8.4/labs/oauth.php<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3321384/ai-engine/trunk/labs/mcp.php<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3321384/ai-engine/trunk/labs/oauth.php<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/1edc84fd-8cb5-4899-9444-1b6ae3144917?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2025-6586 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Download Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the dpwap_plugin_locInstall function in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/download-plugin/tags/2.2.8/app/Plugins/Dpwapuploader.php#L300<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/37734c25-cce3-41fb-babf-714ba7a4bced?source=cve |

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://wordpress.org/plugins/gozen-forms/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d874a041-1cd4-4ca1-85bd-4050630d8502?source=cve |

| 6 | CVE-2025-6814 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Booking X plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the export_now() function in versions 1.0 to 1.1.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to download all plugin data, including user accounts, user meta, and PayPal credentials, by issuing a crafted POST request. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/booking-x/tags/1.1.2/admin/class-bookingx-admin.php#L784<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/booking-x/tags/1.1.2/includes/class-bookingx.php#L322<br>[3]https://wordpress.org/plugins/booking-x/#developers<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6a30d572-e086-4b83-8cb7-4cef9a3253bd?source=cve |

| 52 | CVE-2025-46733 | 7.9  | HIGH | OP-TEE is a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) designed as companion to a non-secure Linux kernel running on Arm; Cortex-A cores using the TrustZone technology. In version 4.5.0, using a specially crafted tee-supplicant binary running in REE userspace, an attacker can trigger a panic in a TA that uses the libutee Secure Storage API. Many functions in libutee, specifically those which make up the Secure Storage API, will panic if a system call returns an unexpected return code. This behavior is mandated by the TEE Internal Core API specification. However, in OP-TEE’s implementation, return codes of secure storage operations are passed through unsanitized from the REE tee-supplicant, through the Linux kernel tee-driver, through the OP-TEE kernel, back to libutee. Thus, an attacker with access to REE userspace, and the ability to stop tee-supplicant and replace it with their own process (generally trivial for a root user, and depending on the way permissions are set up, potentially available even to less privileged users) can run a malicious tee-supplicant process that responds to storage requests with unexpected response codes, triggering a panic in the requesting TA. This is particularly dangerous for TAs built with `TA_FLAG_SINGLE_INSTANCE` (corresponding to `gpd.ta.singleInstance` and `TA_FLAG_INSTANCE_KEEP_ALIVE` (corresponding to `gpd.ta.keepAlive`). The behavior of these TAs may depend on memory that is preserved between sessions, and the ability of an attacker to panic the TA and reload it with a clean memory space can compromise the behavior of those TAs. A critical example of this is the optee_ftpm TA. It uses the kept alive memory to hold PCR values, which crucially must be non-resettable. An attacker who can trigger a panic in the fTPM TA can reset the PCRs, and then extend them PCRs with whatever they choose, falsifying boot measurements, accessing sealed data, and potentially more. The impact of this issue depends significantly on the behavior of affected TAs. For some, it could manifest as a denial of service, while for others, like the fTPM TA, it can result in the disclosure of sensitive data. Anyone running the fTPM TA is affected, but similar attacks may be possible on other TAs that leverage the Secure Storage API. A fix is available in commit 941a58d78c99c4754fbd4ec3079ec9e1d596af8f. | [1]https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/commit/941a58d78c99c4754fbd4ec3079ec9e1d596af8f<br>[2]https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/security/advisories/GHSA-f35r-hm2m-p6c3 |
| 53 | CVE-2025-52496 | 7.8  | HIGH | Mbed TLS before 3.6.4 has a race condition in AESNI detection if certain compiler optimizations occur. An attacker may be able to extract an AES key from a multithreaded program, or perform a GCM forgery. | [1]https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls-docs/blob/main/security-advisories/mbedtls-security-advisory-2025-06-1.md |
| 54 | CVE-2025-48952 | 9.4  | CRITICAL | NetAlertX is a network, presence scanner, and alert framework. Prior to version 25.6.7, a vulnerability in the authentication logic allows users to bypass password verification using SHA-256 magic hashes, due to loose comparison in PHP. In vulnerable versions of the application, a password comparison is performed using the `==` operator at line 40 in front/index.php. This introduces a security issue where specially crafted "magic hash" values that evaluate to true in a loose comparison can bypass authentication. Because of the use of `==` instead of the strict `===`, different strings that begin with 0e and are followed by only digits can be interpreted as scientific notation (i.e., zero) and treated as equal. This issue falls under the Login Bypass vulnerability class. Users with certain "weird" passwords that produce magic hashes are particularly affected. Services relying on this logic are at risk of unauthorized access. Version 25.6.7 fixes the vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/jokob-sk/NetAlertX/security/advisories/GHSA-4p4p-vq2v-9489 |
