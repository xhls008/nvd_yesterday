|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2024-8777 | 7.5  | HIGH | OMFLOW from The SYSCOM Group has an information leakage vulnerability, allowing unauthorized remote attackers to read arbitrary system configurations. If LDAP authentication is enabled, attackers can obtain plaintext credentials. | [1]https://www.twcert.org.tw/en/cp-139-8072-928a5-2.html<br>[2]https://www.twcert.org.tw/tw/cp-132-8071-46589-1.html |
| 2 | CVE-2024-8779 | 8.8  | HIGH | OMFLOW from The SYSCOM Group does not properly restrict access to the system settings modification functionality, allowing remote attackers with regular privileges to update system settings or create accounts with administrator privileges, thereby gaining control of the server. | [1]https://www.twcert.org.tw/en/cp-139-8076-6ade0-2.html<br>[2]https://www.twcert.org.tw/tw/cp-132-8075-a0d06-1.html |
| 3 | CVE-2024-45694 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The web service of certain models of D-Link wireless routers contains a Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability, which allows unauthenticated remote attackers to exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the device. | [1]https://www.twcert.org.tw/en/cp-139-8081-3fb39-2.html<br>[2]https://www.twcert.org.tw/tw/cp-132-8080-7f494-1.html |
| 4 | CVE-2024-45695 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The web service of certain models of D-Link wireless routers contains a Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability, which allows unauthenticated remote attackers to exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the device. | [1]https://www.twcert.org.tw/en/cp-139-8083-a299e-2.html<br>[2]https://www.twcert.org.tw/tw/cp-132-8082-f1687-1.html |
| 5 | CVE-2024-45696 | 8.8  | HIGH | Certain models of D-Link wireless routers contain hidden functionality. By sending specific packets to the web service, the attacker can forcibly enable the telnet service and log in using hard-coded credentials. The telnet service enabled through this method can only be accessed from within the same local network as the device. | [1]https://www.twcert.org.tw/en/cp-139-8087-c3e70-2.html<br>[2]https://www.twcert.org.tw/tw/cp-132-8086-93ed5-1.html |
| 6 | CVE-2024-45697 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Certain models of D-Link wireless routers have a hidden functionality where the telnet service is enabled when the WAN port is plugged in. Unauthorized remote attackers can log in and execute OS commands using hard-coded credentials. | [1]https://www.twcert.org.tw/en/cp-139-8089-32df6-2.html<br>[2]https://www.twcert.org.tw/tw/cp-132-8088-590ed-1.html |
| 7 | CVE-2024-45698 | 8.8  | HIGH | Certain models of D-Link wireless routers do not properly validate user input in the telnet service, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to use hard-coded credentials to log into telnet and inject arbitrary OS commands, which can then be executed on the device. | [1]https://www.twcert.org.tw/en/cp-139-8091-bcd52-2.html<br>[2]https://www.twcert.org.tw/tw/cp-132-8090-bf06b-1.html |
| 8 | CVE-2023-41833 | 7.5  | HIGH | A race condition in UEFI firmware for some Intel(R) processors may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access. | [1]https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-01071.html |
| 9 | CVE-2023-42772 | 8.2  | HIGH | Untrusted pointer dereference in UEFI firmware for some Intel(R) reference processors may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access. | [1]https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-01071.html |

| 11 | CVE-2024-21781 | 7.2  | HIGH | Improper input validation in UEFI firmware for some Intel(R) Processors may allow a privileged user to enable information disclosure or denial of service via local access. | [1]https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-01071.html |
| 12 | CVE-2024-21829 | 7.5  | HIGH | Improper input validation in UEFI firmware error handler for some Intel(R) Processors may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access. | [1]https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-01071.html |
| 13 | CVE-2024-21871 | 7.5  | HIGH | Improper input validation in UEFI firmware for some Intel(R) Processors may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access. | [1]https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-01071.html |
| 14 | CVE-2024-23599 | 7.9  | HIGH | Race condition in Seamless Firmware Updates for some Intel(R) reference platforms may allow a privileged user to potentially enable denial of service via local access. | [1]https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-01071.html |
| 15 | CVE-2024-45799 | 7.3  | HIGH | FluxCP is a web-based Control Panel for rAthena servers written in PHP. A javascript injection is possible via venders/buyers list pages and shop names, that are currently not sanitized. This allows executing arbitrary javascript code on the user`s browser just by visiting the shop pages. As a result all logged in to fluxcp users can have their session info stolen. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.3. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/rathena/FluxCP/security/advisories/GHSA-xvqv-25vf-88g4 |
| 16 | CVE-2024-45801 | 7.3  | HIGH | DOMPurify is a DOM-only, super-fast, uber-tolerant XSS sanitizer for HTML, MathML and SVG. It has been discovered that malicious HTML using special nesting techniques can bypass the depth checking added to DOMPurify in recent releases. It was also possible to use Prototype Pollution to weaken the depth check. This renders dompurify unable to avoid cross site scripting (XSS) attacks. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.5.4 and 3.1.3 of DOMPurify. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/commit/1e520262bf4c66b5efda49e2316d6d1246ca7b21<br>[2]https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/commit/26e1d69ca7f769f5c558619d644d90dd8bf26ebc<br>[3]https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/security/advisories/GHSA-mmhx-hmjr-r674 |
