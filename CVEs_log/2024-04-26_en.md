| 37 | CVE-2024-32651 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | changedetection.io is an open source web page change detection, website watcher, restock monitor and notification service. There is a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Jinja2 that allows Remote Command Execution on the server host. Attackers can run any system command without any restriction and they could use a reverse shell. The impact is critical as the attacker can completely takeover the server machine. This can be reduced if changedetection is behind a login page, but this isn`t required by the application (not by default and not enforced). | [1]https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/releases/tag/0.45.21<br>[2]https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/security/advisories/GHSA-4r7v-whpg-8rx3<br>[3]https://www.onsecurity.io/blog/server-side-template-injection-with-jinja2 |
