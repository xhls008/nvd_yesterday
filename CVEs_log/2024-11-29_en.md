| 1 | CVE-2024-54003 | 8.0  | HIGH | Jenkins Simple Queue Plugin 1.4.4 and earlier does not escape the view name, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with View/Create permission. | [1]https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2024-11-27/#SECURITY-3467 |
| 2 | CVE-2024-7025 | 8.8  | HIGH | Integer overflow in Layout in Google Chrome prior to 129.0.6668.89 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page. (Chromium security severity: High) | [1]https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/10/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html<br>[2]https://issues.chromium.org/issues/367764861 |
| 3 | CVE-2024-41125 | 8.3  | HIGH | Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for IoT devices. An out-of-bounds read of 1 byte can be triggered when sending a packet to a device running the Contiki-NG operating system with SNMP enabled. The SNMP module is disabled in the default Contiki-NG configuration. The vulnerability exists in the os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-ber.c module, where the function snmp_ber_decode_string_len_buffer decodes the string length from a received SNMP packet. In one place, one byte is read from the buffer, without checking that the buffer has another byte available, leading to a possible out-of-bounds read. The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG pull request #2936. It will be included in the next release of Contiki-NG. Users are advised to apply the patch manually or to wait for the next release. A workaround is to disable the SNMP module in the Contiki-NG build configuration. | [1]https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2936<br>[2]https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-qjj3-gqx7-438w |
| 4 | CVE-2024-41126 | 8.3  | HIGH | Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for IoT devices. An out-of-bounds read of 1 byte can be triggered when sending a packet to a device running the Contiki-NG operating system with SNMP enabled. The SNMP module is disabled in the default Contiki-NG configuration. The vulnerability exists in the os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-message.c module, where the snmp_message_decode function fails to check the boundary of the message buffer when reading a byte from it immediately after decoding an object identifier (OID). The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG pull request 2937. It will be included in the next release of Contiki-NG. Users are advised to either apply the patch manually or to wait for the next release. A workaround is to disable the SNMP module in the Contiki-NG build configuration. | [1]https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2937<br>[2]https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-444j-93j3-5gj4 |
| 5 | CVE-2024-47181 | 7.5  | HIGH | Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for IoT devices. An unaligned memory access can be triggered in the two RPL implementations of the Contiki-NG operating system. The problem can occur when either one of these RPL implementations is enabled and connected to an RPL instance. If an IPv6 packet containing an odd number of padded bytes before the RPL option, it can cause the rpl_ext_header_hbh_update function to read a 16-bit integer from an odd address. The impact of this unaligned read is architecture-dependent, but can potentially cause the system to crash. The problem has not been patched as of release 4.9, but will be included in the next release. One can apply the changes in Contiki-NG pull request #2962 to patch the system or wait for the next release. | [1]https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2962<br>[2]https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-crjw-x84h-h6x3 |
| 6 | CVE-2024-53860 | 8.6  | HIGH | sp-php-email-handler is a PHP package for handling contact form submissions. Messages sent using this script are vulnerable to abuse, as the script allows anybody to specify arbitrary email recipients and include user-provided content in confirmation emails. This could enable malicious actors to use your server to send spam, phishing emails, or other malicious content, potentially damaging your domain`s reputation and leading to blacklisting by email providers. Patched in version 1.0.0 by removing user-provided content from confirmation emails. All pre-release versions (alpha and beta) are vulnerable to this issue and should not be used. There are no workarounds for this issue. Users must upgrade to version 1.0.0 to mitigate the vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/Spencer14420/SPEmailHandler-PHP/commit/6f00dd0d44ff27889aed2980a5ba06e60d83549d<br>[2]https://github.com/Spencer14420/SPEmailHandler-PHP/security/advisories/GHSA-mj5r-x73q-fjw6 |
| 7 | CVE-2024-11925 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The JobSearch WP Job Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.7. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a users identity when verifying an email address through the user_account_activation function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user, including site administrators if the users email is known. | [1]https://codecanyon.net/item/jobsearch-wp-job-board-wordpress-plugin/21066856<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/04bc8101-2676-4695-a498-f79be8221617?source=cve |

| 15 | CVE-2024-8672 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | The Widget Options – The #1 WordPress Widget & Block Control Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.7 via the display logic functionality that extends several page builders. This is due to the plugin allowing users to supply input that will be passed through eval() without any filtering or capability checks. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to execute code on the server. Special note: We suggested the vendor implement an allowlist of functions and limit the ability to execute commands to just administrators, however, they did not take our advice. We are considering this patched, however, we believe it could still be further hardened and there may be residual risk with how the issue is currently patched. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/widget-options/trunk/includes/pagebuilders/beaver/beaver.php#L825<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/widget-options/trunk/includes/pagebuilders/elementor/render.php#L379<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/widget-options/trunk/includes/widgets/gutenberg/gutenberg-toolbar.php#L718<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3192921%40widget-options&new=3192921%40widget-options&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/8d03af4d-a1f9-4c15-a62e-f4cdbcfc9af7?source=cve |
