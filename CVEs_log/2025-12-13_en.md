| 1 | CVE-2025-67779 | 7.5  | HIGH | It was found that the fix addressing CVE-2025-55184 in React Server Components was incomplete and does not prevent a denial of service attack in a specific case. React Server Components versions 19.0.2, 19.1.3 and 19.2.2 are affected, allowing unsafe deserialization of payloads from HTTP requests to Server Function endpoints. This can cause an infinite loop that hangs the server process and may prevent future HTTP requests from being served. | [1]https://react.dev/blog/2025/12/11/denial-of-service-and-source-code-exposure-in-react-server-components<br>[2]https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2025-67779 |
| 2 | CVE-2025-10451 | 8.2  | HIGH | Unchecked output buffer may allowed arbitrary code execution in SMM and potentially result in SMM memory corruption. | [1]https://www.insyde.com/security-pledge/sa-2025009/ |
| 3 | CVE-2025-13886 | 7.5  | HIGH | The LT Unleashed plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.1 via the `template` parameter in the `book` shortcode due to insufficient path sanitization. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where files such as wp-config.php can be included. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/lt-unleashed/tags/1.1.1/lt-unleashed.php#L315<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/lt-unleashed/trunk/lt-unleashed.php#L241<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/lt-unleashed/trunk/lt-unleashed.php#L315<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c72099cc-e70a-4afe-92c0-8f9f8c1e91b7?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2025-12824 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Player Leaderboard plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2 via the `player_leaderboard` shortcode. This is due to the plugin using an unsanitized user-supplied value from the shortcode`s `mode` attribute in a call to include() without proper path validation. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary PHP files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve full remote code execution if combined with file upload capabilities. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/player-leaderboard/trunk/public/class-player-leaderboard-public.php#L1419<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3416129%40player-leaderboard&new=3416129%40player-leaderboard<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/527f8f08-bab3-4319-99bf-845c8b378c19?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2025-12963 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The LazyTasks – Project & Task Management with Collaboration, Kanban and Gantt Chart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.29. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user`s identity via the `wp-json/lazytasks/api/v1/user/role/edit/` REST API endpoint prior to updating their details like email address. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user`s email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user`s password and gain access to their account. It is also possible for attackers to abuse this endpoint to grant users with access to additional roles within the plugin | [1]https://wordpress.org/plugins/lazytasks-project-task-management/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c6998185-0f9b-48ab-9dca-05adf5ae603a?source=cve |
| 6 | CVE-2025-12968 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Infility Global plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation and capability checks in all versions up to, and including, 2.14.23. This is due to the `upload_file` function in the `infility_import_file` class only validating the MIME type which can be easily spoofed, and the `import_data` function missing capability checks. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://wordpress.org/plugins/infility-global/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/542a18f6-9d17-4e54-85e1-e01630ca371e?source=cve |
| 7 | CVE-2025-13334 | 8.1  | HIGH | The Blaze Demo Importer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized database resets and file deletion due to a missing capability check on the "blaze_demo_importer_install_demo" function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.13. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber level access and above, to reset the database by truncating all tables (except options, usermeta, and users), delete all sidebar widgets, theme modifications, and content of the uploads folder. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/blaze-demo-importer/tags/1.0.13/blaze-demo-importer.php?marks=67-89#L68<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d83cd6a0-d69c-4e6c-b76f-00c398b5f7e6?source=cve |
| 8 | CVE-2025-14044 | 8.1  | HIGH | The Visitor Logic Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.3 via deserialization of untrusted input from the `lpblocks` cookie. This is due to the `lp_track()` function passing unsanitized cookie data directly to the `unserialize()` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code granted they can access the WordPress site. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/logic-pro/tags/1.0.3/logic-lite.php#L131<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/logic-pro/trunk/logic-lite.php#L131<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/60fb6928-96fb-4c1f-989c-cc07965b5266?source=cve |
| 9 | CVE-2025-14344 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Multi Uploader for Gravity Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the `plupload_ajax_delete_file` function in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/gf-multi-uploader/tags/1.1.7/inc/GFMUHandlePluploader.class.php?marks=41-43#L41<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/346af237-0411-4cc4-9544-eab697385a2f?source=cve |
| 10 | CVE-2025-66492 | 8.2  | HIGH | Masa CMS is an open source Enterprise Content Management platform. Versions 7.2.8 and below, 7.3.1 through 7.3.13, 7.4.0-alpha.1 through 7.4.8 and 7.5.0 through 7.5.1 are vulnerable to XSS when an unsanitized value of the ajax URL query parameter is directly included within the <head> section of the HTML page. An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the context of the user`s session, potentially leading to Session Hijacking, Data Theft, Defacement and Malware Distribution. This issue is fixed in versions 7.5.2, 7.4.9, 7.3.14, and 7.2.9. To work around this issue, configure a Web Application Firewall (WAF) rule (e.g., ModSecurity) to block requests containing common XSS payload characters in the ajax query parameter. Alternatively, implement server-side sanitization using middleware to strip or escape dangerous characters from the ajax parameter before it reaches the vulnerable rendering logic. | [1]https://github.com/MasaCMS/MasaCMS/commit/376c27196b1e2489888b7a000cdf5c45bb85959e<br>[2]https://github.com/MasaCMS/MasaCMS/security/advisories/GHSA-249c-vqwv-43vc |
| 11 | CVE-2025-67725 | 7.5  | HIGH | Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. In versions 6.5.2 and below, a single maliciously crafted HTTP request can block the server`s event loop for an extended period, caused by the HTTPHeaders.add method. The function accumulates values using string concatenation when the same header name is repeated, causing a Denial of Service (DoS).  Due to Python string immutability, each concatenation copies the entire string, resulting in O(n²) time complexity. The severity can vary from high if max_header_size has been increased from its default, to low if it has its default value of 64KB. This issue is fixed in version 6.5.3. | [1]https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/commit/771472cfdaeebc0d89a9cc46e249f8891a6b29cd<br>[2]https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/releases/tag/v6.5.3<br>[3]https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/security/advisories/GHSA-c98p-7wgm-6p64 |
| 12 | CVE-2025-12570 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Fancy Product Designer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the data-to-image.php and pdf-to-image.php files. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file. | [1]https://codecanyon.net/item/fancy-product-designer-woocommercewordpress/6318393<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/2db4eb1d-3a82-4f0f-b4ff-a291b0289b7f?source=cve |
| 13 | CVE-2025-14068 | 7.5  | HIGH | The WPNakama plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the `order_by` parameter in all versions up to, and including, 0.6.3 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpnakama/tags/0.6.3/inc/class-wpnakama-api.php#L206<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpnakama/tags/0.6.3/inc/class-wpnakama.php#L197<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpnakama/trunk/inc/class-wpnakama-api.php#L206<br>[5]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpnakama/trunk/inc/class-wpnakama.php#L197<br>[6]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3412904%40wpnakama&new=3412904%40wpnakama&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[7]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/9abfd0f5-f665-4745-9756-8445ddbdc29d?source=cve |
| 14 | CVE-2025-67726 | 7.5  | HIGH | Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. Versions 6.5.2 and below use an inefficient algorithm when parsing parameters for HTTP header values, potentially causing a DoS. The _parseparam function in httputil.py is used to parse specific HTTP header values, such as those in multipart/form-data and repeatedly calls string.count() within a nested loop while processing quoted semicolons. If an attacker sends a request with a large number of maliciously crafted parameters in a Content-Disposition header, the server`s CPU usage increases quadratically (O(n²)) during parsing. Due to Tornado`s single event loop architecture, a single malicious request can cause the entire server to become unresponsive for an extended period. This issue is fixed in version 6.5.3. | [1]https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/commit/771472cfdaeebc0d89a9cc46e249f8891a6b29cd<br>[2]https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/releases/tag/v6.5.3<br>[3]https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/security/advisories/GHSA-jhmp-mqwm-3gq8 |
| 15 | CVE-2025-67728 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Fireshare facilitates self-hosted media and link sharing. Versions 1.2.30 and below allow an authenticated user, or unauthenticated user if the Public Uploads setting is enabled, to craft a malicious filename when uploading a video file. The malicious filename is then concatenated directly into a shell command, which can be used for uploading files to arbitrary directories via path traversal, or executing system commands for Remote Code Execution (RCE). This issue is fixed in version 1.3.0. | [1]https://github.com/ShaneIsrael/fireshare/commit/157386c85f6683f89192dae52115069b435b6d34<br>[2]https://github.com/ShaneIsrael/fireshare/security/advisories/GHSA-c4f5-g622-q72m |
