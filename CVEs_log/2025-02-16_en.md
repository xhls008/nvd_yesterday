| 1 | CVE-2025-26819 | 8.6  | HIGH | Monero through 0.18.3.4 before ec74ff4 does not have response limits on HTTP server connections. | [1]https://github.com/monero-project/monero/commit/ec74ff4a3d3ca38b7912af680209a45fd1701c3d |
| 2 | CVE-2024-13513 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Oliver POS – A WooCommerce Point of Sale (POS) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.2.3 via the logging functionality. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data including the plugin`s clientToken, which in turn can be used to change user account information including emails and account type. This allows attackers to then change account passwords resulting in a complete site takeover. Version 2.4.2.3 disabled logging but left sites with existing log files vulnerable. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/oliver-pos/trunk/includes/models/class-pos-bridge-user.php#L373<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3234731%40oliver-pos%2Ftrunk&old=3056051%40oliver-pos%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/bf6b7d8d-fb13-4eb4-b0b4-d0a10ad2a21e?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2024-12562 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The s2Member Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 241216 via deserialization of untrusted input from the `s2member_pro_remote_op` vulnerable parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. | [1]https://s2member.com/changelog/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/65192fdb-86db-475a-8c61-4db922920cfe?source=cve |
