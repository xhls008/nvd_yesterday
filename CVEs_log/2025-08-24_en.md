|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2025-7642 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Simpler Checkout plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in versions 0.7.0 to 1.1.9. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user`s identity prior to logging them in as an admin through the simplerwc_woocommerce_order_created() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as other users based on their order ID, which can be an administrator if a site admin has placed a test order. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/simpler-checkout/tags/1.1.9/includes/hooks.php#L7<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/02cf0e1a-bd12-44b1-9bc5-1a5ec332b000?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2025-9048 | 8.1  | HIGH | The Wptobe-memberships plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the del_img_ajax_call() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). | [1]https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/wptobe-memberships/trunk/bwlms-fields/bwlms-fields.php<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wptobe-memberships/trunk/bwlms-fields/bwlms-fields.php#L156<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/466568c5-33a9-4891-b4ad-9bc6052603cb?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2025-7813 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Events Calendar, Event Booking, Registrations and Event Tickets â€“ Eventin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.37 via the proxy_image function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and modify information from internal services. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-event-solution/trunk/core/Admin/hooks.php#L451<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3345781/wp-event-solution/tags/4.0.38/core/Admin/hooks.php<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/a73f806d-5d64-4df5-b032-3d3a149036ff?source=cve<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/wordpress-plugins/wp-event-solution/event-manager-events-calendar-tickets-registrations-eventin-4026-unauthenticated-arbitrary-file-read |
| 4 | CVE-2025-9357 | 8.8  | HIGH | A vulnerability was identified in Linksys RE6250, RE6300, RE6350, RE6500, RE7000 and RE9000 1.0.013.001/1.0.04.001/1.0.04.002/1.1.05.003/1.2.07.001.
