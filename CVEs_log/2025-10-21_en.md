| 6 | CVE-2025-57738 | 7.2  | HIGH | Apache Syncope offers the ability to extend / customize the base behavior on every deployment by allowing to provide custom implementations of a few Java interfaces; such implementations can be provided either as Java or Groovy classes, with the latter being particularly attractive as the machinery is set for runtime reload.Such a feature has been available for a while, but recently it was discovered that a malicious administrator can inject Groovy code that can be executed remotely by a running Apache Syncope Core instance.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.0.14 / 4.0.2, which fix this issue by forcing the Groovy code to run in a sandbox. | [1]https://lists.apache.org/thread/x7cv6xv7z76y49grdr1hgj1pzw5zbby6 |
| 7 | CVE-2025-61417 | 8.8  | HIGH | Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in TastyIgniter 3.7.7, affecting the /admin/media_manager component.

| 11 | CVE-2025-62429 | 7.2  | HIGH | ClipBucket v5 is an open source video sharing platform. Prior to version 5.5.2 #147, ClipBucket v5 is vulnerable to arbitrary PHP code execution. In /upload/admin_area/actions/update_launch.php, the "type" parameter from a POST request is embedded into PHP tags and executed. Proper sanitization is not performed, and by injecting malicious code an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code. This allows an attacker to achieve RCE. This issue has been resolved in version 5.5.2 #147. | [1]https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/commit/e81bac602c871bb1ad971884003a3a496a2ab50b<br>[2]https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/releases/tag/5.5.2-%23147<br>[3]https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/security/advisories/GHSA-3x4g-x3gv-rjmq<br>[4]https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/security/advisories/GHSA-3x4g-x3gv-rjmq |

| 14 | CVE-2025-62509 | 8.1  | HIGH | FileRise is a self-hosted web-based file manager with multi-file upload, editing, and batch operations. Prior to version 1.4.0, a business logic flaw in FileRise’s file/folder handling allows low-privilege users to perform unauthorized operations (view/delete/modify) on files created by other users. The root cause was inferring ownership/visibility from folder names (e.g., a folder named after a username) and missing server-side authorization/ownership checks across file operation endpoints. This amounted to an IDOR pattern: an attacker could operate on resources identified only by predictable names. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.0 and further hardened in version 1.5.0. A workaround for this issue involves restricting non-admin users to read-only or disable delete/rename APIs server-side, avoid creating top-level folders named after other usernames, and adding server-side checks that verify ownership before delete/rename/move. | [1]https://github.com/error311/FileRise/commit/25ce6a76beb60950359c0304765ad91a8aff8ad8<br>[2]https://github.com/error311/FileRise/issues/53<br>[3]https://github.com/error311/FileRise/security/advisories/GHSA-6p87-q9rh-95wh |
| 15 | CVE-2025-62510 | 8.1  | HIGH | FileRise is a self-hosted web-based file manager with multi-file upload, editing, and batch operations. In version 1.4.0, a regression allowed folder visibility/ownership to be inferred from folder names. Low-privilege users could see or interact with folders matching their username and, in some cases, other users’ content. This issue has been patched in version 1.5.0, where it introduces explicit per-folder ACLs (owners/read/write/share/read_own) and strict server-side checks across list, read, write, share, rename, copy/move, zip, and WebDAV paths. | [1]https://github.com/error311/FileRise/commit/b6d86b78967baa2f5a1e191903fc4df13998d87f<br>[2]https://github.com/error311/FileRise/issues/55<br>[3]https://github.com/error311/FileRise/security/advisories/GHSA-jm96-2w52-5qjj |
| 16 | CVE-2025-61488 | 7.6  | HIGH | An issue in Senayan Library Management System (SLiMS) 9 Bulian v.9.6.1 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the scrap_image.php component and the imageURL parameter | [1]https://github.com/slims/slims9_bulian/issues/299 |
| 17 | CVE-2025-62527 | 7.1  | HIGH | Taguette is an open source qualitative research tool. An issue has been discovered in Taguette versions prior to 1.5.0. It was possible for an attacker to request password reset email containing a malicious link, allowing the attacker to set the email if clicked by the victim. This issue has been patched in version 1.5.0. | [1]https://github.com/remram44/taguette/security/advisories/GHSA-7rc8-5c8q-jr6j<br>[2]https://gitlab.com/remram44/taguette/-/issues/331 |
