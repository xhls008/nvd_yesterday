| 50 | CVE-2025-62370 | 7.5  | HIGH | Alloy Core libraries at the root of the Rust Ethereum ecosystem. Prior to 0.8.26 and 1.4.1, an uncaught panic triggered by malformed input to alloy_dyn_abi::TypedData could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) via eip712_signing_hash(). Software with high availability requirements such as network services may be particularly impacted. If in use, external auto-restarting mechanisms can partially mitigate the availability issues unless repeated attacks are possible. The vulnerability was patched by adding a check to ensure the element is not empty before accessing its first element; an error is returned if it is empty. The fix is included in version v1.4.1 and backported to v0.8.26. | [1]https://crates.io/crates/alloy-dyn-abi/0.8.26<br>[2]https://crates.io/crates/alloy-dyn-abi/1.4.1<br>[3]https://github.com/alloy-rs/core/commit/7823e9af8c20e9fcfb5360f5eafd891c457ebccf<br>[4]https://github.com/alloy-rs/core/security/advisories/GHSA-pgp9-98jm-wwq2<br>[5]https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0073.html |
| 51 | CVE-2025-62371 | 7.4  | HIGH | OpenSearch Data Prepper as an open source data collector for observability data. In versions prior to 2.12.2, the OpenSearch sink and source plugins in Data Prepper trust all SSL certificates by default when no certificate path is provided. Prior to this fix, the OpenSearch sink and source plugins would automatically use a trust all SSL strategy when connecting to OpenSearch clusters if no certificate path was explicitly configured. This behavior bypasses SSL certificate validation, potentially allowing attackers to intercept and modify data in transit through man-in-the-middle attacks. The vulnerability affects connections to OpenSearch when the cert parameter is not explicitly provided. This issue has been patched in version 2.12.2. As a workaround, users can add the cert parameter to their OpenSearch sink or source configuration with the path to the cluster`s CA certificate. | [1]https://github.com/opensearch-project/data-prepper/commit/98fcf0d0ff9c18f1f7501e11dbed918814724b99<br>[2]https://github.com/opensearch-project/data-prepper/commit/b0386a5af3fb71094ba6c86cd8b2afc783246599<br>[3]https://github.com/opensearch-project/data-prepper/commit/db11ce8f27ebca018980b2bca863f7173de9ce56<br>[4]https://github.com/opensearch-project/data-prepper/security/advisories/GHSA-43ff-rr26-8hx4 |
| 52 | CVE-2025-62382 | 7.7  | HIGH | Frigate is a network video recorder (NVR) with realtime local object detection for IP cameras. Prior to 0.16.2, Frigate`s export workflow allows an authenticated operator to nominate any filesystem location as the thumbnail source for a video export. Because that path is copied verbatim into the publicly served clips directory, the feature can be abused to read arbitrary files that reside on the host running Frigate. In practice, a low-privilege user with API access can pivot from viewing camera footage to exfiltrating sensitive configuration files, secrets, or user data from the appliance itself. This behavior violates the principle of least privilege for the export subsystem and turns a convenience feature into a direct information disclosure vector, with exploitation hinging on a short race window while the background exporter copies the chosen file into place before cleanup runs. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.16.2. | [1]https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/commit/d7f7cd7be16bfe7a12766b797da6b8add687ccd9<br>[2]https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/security/advisories/GHSA-8gv4-5jr9-v96j |
