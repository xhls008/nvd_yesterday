| 1 | CVE-2023-49785 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | NextChat, also known as ChatGPT-Next-Web, is a cross-platform chat user interface for use with ChatGPT. Versions 2.11.2 and prior are vulnerable to server-side request forgery and cross-site scripting. This vulnerability enables read access to internal HTTP endpoints but also write access using HTTP POST, PUT, and other methods. Attackers can also use this vulnerability to mask their source IP by forwarding malicious traffic intended for other Internet targets through these open proxies. As of time of publication, no patch is available, but other mitigation strategies are available. Users may avoid exposing the application to the public internet or, if exposing the application to the internet, ensure it is an isolated network with no access to any other internal resources. | [1]https://github.com/ChatGPTNextWeb/ChatGPT-Next-Web<br>[2]https://www.horizon3.ai/attack-research/attack-blogs/nextchat-an-ai-chatbot-that-lets-you-talk-to-anyone-you-want-to/ |

| 77 | CVE-2022-34321 | 8.2  | HIGH | Improper Authentication vulnerability in Apache Pulsar Proxy allows an attacker to connect to the /proxy-stats endpoint without authentication. The vulnerable endpoint exposes detailed statistics about live connections, along with the capability to modify the logging level of proxied connections without requiring proper authentication credentials.This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.6.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.2, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.1, and 3.1.0.The known risks include exposing sensitive information such as connected client IP and unauthorized logging level manipulation which could lead to a denial-of-service condition by significantly increasing the proxy`s logging overhead. When deployed via the Apache Pulsar Helm chart within Kubernetes environments, the actual client IP might not be revealed through the load balancer`s default behavior, which typically obscures the original source IP addresses when externalTrafficPolicy is being configured to "Cluster" by default. The /proxy-stats endpoint contains topic level statistics, however, in the default configuration, the topic level statistics aren`t known to be exposed.2.10 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.10.6.2.11 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.11.3.3.0 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 3.0.2.3.1 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 3.1.1.Users operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions. Additionally, it`s imperative to recognize that the Apache Pulsar Proxy is not intended for direct exposure to the internet. The architectural design of Pulsar Proxy assumes that it will operate within a secured network environment, safeguarded by appropriate perimeter defenses. | [1]https://lists.apache.org/thread/ods5tq2hpl390hvjnvxv0bcg4rfpgjj8<br>[2]https://pulsar.apache.org/security/CVE-2022-34321/ |

This occurs when the filenames in the zip files, which aren`t properly validated, contain special elements like "..", altering the directory path. This could allow an attacker to create or modify files outside of the designated extraction directory, potentially influencing system behavior. This vulnerability also applies to the Pulsar Broker when it is configured with "functionsWorkerEnabled=true".This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.4.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.3, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.2, from 3.1.0 to 3.1.2, and 3.2.0. 2.10 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.10.6.2.11 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.11.4.3.0 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.0.3.3.1 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.1.3.3.2 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.2.1.Users operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions. | [1]https://lists.apache.org/thread/ct9xmvlf7lompc1pxvlsb60qstfsm9po<br>[2]https://pulsar.apache.org/security/CVE-2024-27317/ |
| 80 | CVE-2024-27894 | 8.5  | HIGH | The Pulsar Functions Worker includes a capability that permits authenticated users to create functions where the function`s implementation is referenced by a URL. The supported URL schemes include "file", "http", and "https". When a function is created using this method, the Functions Worker will retrieve the implementation from the URL provided by the user. However, this feature introduces a vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to any file that the Pulsar Functions Worker process has permissions to read. This includes reading the process environment which potentially includes sensitive information, such as secrets. Furthermore, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to use the Pulsar Functions Worker as a proxy to access the content of remote HTTP and HTTPS endpoint URLs. This could also be used to carry out denial of service attacks.This vulnerability also applies to the Pulsar Broker when it is configured with "functionsWorkerEnabled=true".This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.4.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.3, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.2, from 3.1.0 to 3.1.2, and 3.2.0. 2.10 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.10.6.2.11 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.11.4.3.0 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.0.3.3.1 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.1.3.3.2 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.2.1.Users operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions.The updated versions of Pulsar Functions Worker will, by default, impose restrictions on the creation of functions using URLs. For users who rely on this functionality, the Function Worker configuration provides two configuration keys: "additionalEnabledConnectorUrlPatterns" and "additionalEnabledFunctionsUrlPatterns". These keys allow users to specify a set of URL patterns that are permitted, enabling the creation of functions using URLs that match the defined patterns. This approach ensures that the feature remains available to those who require it, while limiting the potential for unauthorized access and exploitation. | [1]https://lists.apache.org/thread/45cqhgqg8d19ongjw18ypcss8vwh206p<br>[2]https://pulsar.apache.org/security/CVE-2024-27894/ |

| 82 | CVE-2024-28121 | 8.8  | HIGH | stimulus_reflex is a system to extend the capabilities of both Rails and Stimulus by intercepting user interactions and passing them to Rails over real-time websockets. In affected versions more methods than expected can be called on reflex instances. Being able to call some of them has security implications. To invoke a reflex a websocket message of the following shape is sent: `\"target\":\"[class_name]#[method_name]\",\"args\":[]`. The server will proceed to instantiate `reflex` using the provided `class_name` as long as it extends `StimulusReflex::Reflex`. It then attempts to call `method_name` on the instance with the provided arguments. This is problematic as `reflex.method method_name` can be more methods that those explicitly specified by the developer in their reflex class. A good example is the instance_variable_set method. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 3.4.2 and 3.5.0.rc4. Users unable to upgrade should: see the backing GHSA advisory for mitigation advice. | [1]http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Mar/16<br>[2]https://github.com/stimulusreflex/stimulus_reflex/blob/0211cad7d60fe96838587f159d657e44cee51b9b/app/channels/stimulus_reflex/channel.rb#L83<br>[3]https://github.com/stimulusreflex/stimulus_reflex/commit/538582d240439aab76066c72335ea92096cd0c7f<br>[4]https://github.com/stimulusreflex/stimulus_reflex/releases/tag/v3.4.2<br>[5]https://github.com/stimulusreflex/stimulus_reflex/releases/tag/v3.5.0.rc4<br>[6]https://github.com/stimulusreflex/stimulus_reflex/security/advisories/GHSA-f78j-4w3g-4q65 |
| 83 | CVE-2024-28186 | 7.1  | HIGH | FreeScout is an open source help desk and shared inbox built with PHP.A vulnerability has been identified in the Free Scout Application, which exposes SMTP server credentials used by an organization in the application to users of the application. This issue arises from the application storing complete stack traces of exceptions in its database. The sensitive information is then inadvertently disclosed to users via the `/conversation/ajax-html/send_log?folder_id=&thread_id={id}` endpoint. The stack trace reveals value of parameters, including the username and password, passed to the `Swift_Transport_Esmtp_Auth_LoginAuthenticator->authenticate()` function. Exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to SMTP server credentials. With this sensitive information in hand, the attacker can potentially send unauthorized emails from the compromised SMTP server, posing a severe threat to the confidentiality and integrity of email communications. This could lead to targeted attacks on both the application users and the organization itself, compromising the security of email exchange servers. This issue has been addressed in version 1.8.124. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should adopt the following measures: 1. Avoid Storing Complete Stack Traces, 2. Implement redaction mechanisms to filter and exclude sensitive information, and 3. Review and enhance the application`s logging practices. | [1]https://github.com/freescout-helpdesk/freescout/commit/33639a89554998dcac645613130a27ac7872605e<br>[2]https://github.com/freescout-helpdesk/freescout/security/advisories/GHSA-7wcq-2qmv-mvcm |
| 84 | CVE-2024-28236 | 7.7  | HIGH | Vela is a Pipeline Automation (CI/CD) framework built on Linux container technology written in Golang. Vela pipelines can use variable substitution combined with insensitive fields like `parameters`, `image` and `entrypoint` to inject secrets into a plugin/image and — by using common substitution string manipulation — can bypass log masking and expose secrets without the use of the commands block. This unexpected behavior primarily impacts secrets restricted by the "no commands" option. This can lead to unintended use of the secret value, and increased risk of exposing the secret during image execution bypassing log masking. **To exploit this** the pipeline author must be supplying the secrets to a plugin that is designed in such a way that will print those parameters in logs. Plugin parameters are not designed for sensitive values and are often intentionally printed throughout execution for informational/debugging purposes. Parameters should therefore be treated as insensitive. While Vela provides secrets masking, secrets exposure is not entirely solved by the masking process. A docker image (plugin) can easily expose secrets if they are not handled properly, or altered in some way. There is a responsibility on the end-user to understand how values injected into a plugin are used. This is a risk that exists for many CICD systems (like GitHub Actions) that handle sensitive runtime variables. Rather, the greater risk is that users who restrict a secret to the "no commands" option and use image restriction can still have their secret value exposed via substitution tinkering, which turns the image and command restrictions into a false sense of security. This issue has been addressed in version 0.23.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not provide sensitive values to plugins that can potentially expose them, especially in `parameters` that are not intended to be used for sensitive values, ensure plugins (especially those that utilize shared secrets) follow best practices to avoid logging parameters that are expected to be sensitive, minimize secrets with `pull_request` events enabled, as this allows users to change pipeline configurations and pull in secrets to steps not typically part of the CI process, make use of the build approval setting, restricting builds from untrusted users, and limit use of shared secrets, as they are less restrictive to access by nature. | [1]https://github.com/go-vela/worker/commit/e1572743b008e4fbce31ebb1dcd23bf6a1a30297<br>[2]https://github.com/go-vela/worker/security/advisories/GHSA-pwx5-6wxg-px5h |
