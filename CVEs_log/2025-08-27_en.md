| 23 | CVE-2025-55298 | 7.5  | HIGH | ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital images. Prior to ImageMagick versions 6.9.13-28 and 7.1.2-2, a format string bug vulnerability exists in InterpretImageFilename function where user input is directly passed to FormatLocaleString without proper sanitization. An attacker can overwrite arbitrary memory regions, enabling a wide range of attacks from heap overflow to remote code execution. This issue has been patched in versions 6.9.13-28 and 7.1.2-2. | [1]https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/439b362b93c074eea6c3f834d84982b43ef057d5<br>[2]https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/security/advisories/GHSA-9ccg-6pjw-x645<br>[3]https://github.com/dlemstra/Magick.NET/releases/tag/14.8.1<br>[4]https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/security/advisories/GHSA-9ccg-6pjw-x645 |
| 24 | CVE-2025-57803 | 7.5  | HIGH | ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital images. Prior to versions 6.9.13-28 and 7.1.2-2 for ImageMagick`s 32-bit build, a 32-bit integer overflow in the BMP encoder’s scanline-stride computation collapses bytes_per_line (stride) to a tiny value while the per-row writer still emits 3 × width bytes for 24-bpp images. The row base pointer advances using the (overflowed) stride, so the first row immediately writes past its slot and into adjacent heap memory with attacker-controlled bytes. This is a classic, powerful primitive for heap corruption in common auto-convert pipelines. This issue has been patched in versions 6.9.13-28 and 7.1.2-2. | [1]https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/2c55221f4d38193adcb51056c14cf238fbcc35d7<br>[2]https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/security/advisories/GHSA-mxvv-97wh-cfmm<br>[3]https://github.com/dlemstra/Magick.NET/releases/tag/14.8.1<br>[4]https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/security/advisories/GHSA-mxvv-97wh-cfmm |
