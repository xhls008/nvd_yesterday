| 1 | CVE-2024-6750 | 7.3  | HIGH | The Social Auto Poster plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access, modification, and loss of data due to a missing capability check on multiple functions in all versions up to, and including, 5.3.14. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add, modify, or delete post meta and plugin options. | [1]https://codecanyon.net/item/social-auto-poster-wordpress-scheduler-marketing-plugin/5754169<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/36b58a4f-0761-4775-9010-9c77d4019c44?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2024-6753 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Social Auto Poster plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘mapTypes’ parameter in the `wpw_auto_poster_map_wordpress_post_type` AJAX function in all versions up to, and including, 5.3.14 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. | [1]https://codecanyon.net/item/social-auto-poster-wordpress-scheduler-marketing-plugin/5754169<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/3c268a6d-dfb4-4a9d-802e-80e5c1c53ca2?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2024-6756 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Social Auto Poster plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the `wpw_auto_poster_get_image_path` function in all versions up to, and including, 5.3.14. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level and above permissions, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. An attacker can use CVE-2024-6754 to exploit with subscriber-level access. | [1]https://codecanyon.net/item/social-auto-poster-wordpress-scheduler-marketing-plugin/5754169<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/24e00c0d-08ff-4c68-a1dd-77b513545efd?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2024-7027 | 7.3  | HIGH | The WooCommerce - PDF Vouchers plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 4.9.3. This is due to insufficient verification on the user being supplied during a QR code login through the plugin. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing Voucher Vendor user on the site, if they have access to the user id. | [1]https://codecanyon.net/item/woocommerce-pdf-vouchers-ultimate-gift-cards-wordpress-plugin/7392046<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b6cf27d9-c0be-4cff-8867-19297f6d79d7?source=cve |

| 10 | CVE-2024-41110 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | Moby is an open-source project created by Docker for software containerization. A security vulnerability has been detected in certain versions of Docker Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ) under specific circumstances. The base likelihood of this being exploited is low.Using a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the daemon forward the request or response to an authorization plugin without the body. In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.A security issue was discovered In 2018, where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation. Although this issue was fixed in Docker Engine v18.09.1 in January 2019, the fix was not carried forward to later major versions, resulting in a regression. Anyone who depends on authorization plugins that introspect the request and/or response body to make access control decisions is potentially impacted.Docker EE v19.03.x and all versions of Mirantis Container Runtime are not vulnerable.docker-ce v27.1.1 containes patches to fix the vulnerability. Patches have also been merged into the master, 19.0, 20.0, 23.0, 24.0, 25.0, 26.0, and 26.1 release branches. If one is unable to upgrade immediately, avoid using AuthZ plugins and/or restrict access to the Docker API to trusted parties, following the principle of least privilege. | [1]https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/411e817ddf710ff8e08fa193da80cb78af708191<br>[2]https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/42f40b1d6dd7562342f832b9cd2adf9e668eeb76<br>[3]https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/65cc597cea28cdc25bea3b8a86384b4251872919<br>[4]https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/852759a7df454cbf88db4e954c919becd48faa9b<br>[5]https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/a31260625655cff9ae226b51757915e275e304b0<br>[6]https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/a79fabbfe84117696a19671f4aa88b82d0f64fc1<br>[7]https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/ae160b4edddb72ef4bd71f66b975a1a1cc434f00<br>[8]https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/ae2b3666c517c96cbc2adf1af5591a6b00d4ec0f<br>[9]https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/cc13f952511154a2866bddbb7dddebfe9e83b801<br>[10]https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/fc274cd2ff4cf3b48c91697fb327dd1fb95588fb<br>[11]https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-v23v-6jw2-98fq<br>[12]https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-security-advisory-docker-engine-authz-plugin |
| 11 | CVE-2024-41662 | 8.6  | HIGH | VNote is a note-taking platform. A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the Markdown rendering functionality of versions 3.18.1 and prior of the VNote note-taking application. This vulnerability allows the injection and execution of arbitrary JavaScript code through which remote code execution can be achieved. A patch for this issue is available at commit f1af78573a0ef51d6ef6a0bc4080cddc8f30a545. Other mitigation strategies include implementing rigorous input sanitization for all Markdown content and utilizing a secure Markdown parser that appropriately escapes or strips potentially dangerous content. | [1]https://github.com/vnotex/vnote/commit/f1af78573a0ef51d6ef6a0bc4080cddc8f30a545<br>[2]https://github.com/vnotex/vnote/security/advisories/GHSA-w655-h68w-vxxc |
| 12 | CVE-2024-41667 | 8.8  | HIGH | OpenAM is an open access management solution. In versions 15.0.3 and prior, the `getCustomLoginUrlTemplate` method in RealmOAuth2ProviderSettings.java is vulnerable to template injection due to its usage of user input. Although the developer intended to implement a custom URL for handling login to override the default PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud login page,they did not restrict the `CustomLoginUrlTemplate`, allowing it to be set freely. Commit fcb8432aa77d5b2e147624fe954cb150c568e0b8 introduces `TemplateClassResolver.SAFER_RESOLVER` to disable the resolution of commonly exploited classes in FreeMarker template injection. As of time of publication, this fix is expected to be part of version 15.0.4. | [1]https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenAM/commit/fcb8432aa77d5b2e147624fe954cb150c568e0b8<br>[2]https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenAM/security/advisories/GHSA-7726-43hg-m23v |
| 13 | CVE-2024-41672 | 7.5  | HIGH | DuckDB is a SQL database management system. In versions 1.0.0 and prior, content in filesystem is accessible for reading using `sniff_csv`, even with `enable_external_access=false`. This vulnerability provides an attacker with access to filesystem even when access is expected to be disabled and other similar functions do NOT provide access. There seem to be two vectors to this vulnerability. First, access to files that should otherwise not be allowed. Second, the content from a file can be read (e.g. `/etc/hosts`, `proc/self/environ`, etc) even though that doesn`t seem to be the intent of the sniff_csv function. A fix for this issue is available in commit c9b7c98aa0e1cd7363fe8bb8543a95f38e980d8a and is expected to be part of version 1.1.0. | [1]https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/commit/c9b7c98aa0e1cd7363fe8bb8543a95f38e980d8a<br>[2]https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/13133<br>[3]https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/security/advisories/GHSA-w2gf-jxc9-pf2q |
