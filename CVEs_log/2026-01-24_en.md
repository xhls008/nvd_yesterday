| 1 | CVE-2026-20613 | 7.8  | HIGH | The ArchiveReader.extractContents() function used by cctl image load and container image load performs no pathname validation before extracting an archive member. This means that a carelessly or maliciously constructed archive can extract a file into any user-writable location on the system using relative pathnames. This issue is addressed in container 0.8.0 and containerization 0.21.0. | [1]https://github.com/apple/containerization/security/advisories/GHSA-cq3j-qj2h-6rv3 |
| 2 | CVE-2026-24138 | 7.5  | HIGH | FOG is a free open-source cloning/imaging/rescue suite/inventory management system. Versions 1.5.10.1754 and below contain an unauthenticated SSRF vulnerability in getversion.php which can be triggered by providing a user-controlled url parameter. It can be used to fetch both internal websites and files on the machine running FOG. This appears to be reachable without an authenticated web session when the request includes newService=1. The issue does not have a fixed release version at the time of publication. | [1]https://github.com/FOGProject/fogproject/security/advisories/GHSA-79xw-c2qx-g7xj |
| 3 | CVE-2026-24304 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | Improper access control in Azure Resource Manager allows an authorized attacker to elevate privileges over a network. | [1]https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2026-24304 |
| 4 | CVE-2026-0710 | 8.4  | HIGH | A flaw was found in SIPp. A remote attacker could exploit this by sending specially crafted Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) messages during an active call. This vulnerability, a NULL pointer dereference, can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service. Under specific conditions, it may also allow an attacker to execute unauthorized code, compromising the system`s integrity and availability. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2026-0710<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2427788 |
| 5 | CVE-2025-3839 | 8.0  | HIGH | A flaw was found in Epiphany, a tool that allows websites to open external URL handler applications with minimal user interaction.
