As of commit 4f5759dbfb4506c7b6280572a4db1aabc1ac778d, using `pull_request_target` on `.github/workflows/integration_tests.yml` followed by the checking out the head.sha of a forked PR can be exploited by attackers, since untrusted code can be executed having full access to secrets (from the base repo). By exploiting the vulnerability is possible to exfiltrate `GITHUB_TOKEN` and secrets `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID`,  `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET`. In particular `GITHUB_TOKEN` which can be used to completely overtake the repo since the token has content write privileges. The `pull_request_target` in GitHub Actions is a major security concern—especially in public repositories—because it executes untrusted code from a PR, but with the context of the base repository, including access to its secrets.

| 43 | CVE-2025-47275 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | Auth0-PHP provides the PHP SDK for Auth0 Authentication and Management APIs. Starting in version 8.0.0-BETA1 and prior to version 8.14.0, session cookies of applications using the Auth0-PHP SDK configured with CookieStore have authentication tags that can be brute forced, which may result in unauthorized access. Certain pre-conditions are required to be vulnerable to this issue: Applications using the Auth0-PHP SDK, or the Auth0/symfony, Auth0/laravel-auth0, and Auth0/wordpress SDKs that rely on the Auth0-PHP SDK; and session storage configured with CookieStore. Upgrade Auth0/Auth0-PHP to v8.14.0 to receive a patch. As an additional precautionary measure, rotating cookie encryption keys is recommended. Note that once updated, any previous session cookies will be rejected. | [1]https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP/commit/52a79480fdb246f59dbc089b81a784ae049bd389<br>[2]https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP/releases/tag/8.14.0<br>[3]https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP/security/advisories/GHSA-g98g-r7gf-2r25<br>[4]https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0/security/advisories/GHSA-9fwj-9mjf-rhj3<br>[5]https://github.com/auth0/symfony/security/advisories/GHSA-9wg9-93h9-j8ch<br>[6]https://github.com/auth0/wordpress/security/advisories/GHSA-2f4r-34m4-3w8q |
| 44 | CVE-2025-47287 | 7.5  | HIGH | Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. When Tornado`s ``multipart/form-data`` parser encounters certain errors, it logs a warning but continues trying to parse the remainder of the data. This allows remote attackers to generate an extremely high volume of logs, constituting a DoS attack. This DoS is compounded by the fact that the logging subsystem is synchronous. All versions of Tornado prior to 6.5.0 are affected. The vulnerable parser is enabled by default. Upgrade to Tornado version 6.50 to receive a patch. As a workaround, risk can be mitigated by blocking `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` in a proxy. | [1]https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/commit/b39b892bf78fe8fea01dd45199aa88307e7162f3<br>[2]https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/security/advisories/GHSA-7cx3-6m66-7c5m |
