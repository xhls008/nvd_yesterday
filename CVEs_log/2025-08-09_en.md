| 1 | CVE-2025-54952 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | An integer overflow vulnerability in the loading of ExecuTorch models can cause smaller-than-expected memory regions to be allocated, potentially resulting in code execution or other undesirable effects. This issue affects ExecuTorch prior to commit 8f062d3f661e20bb19b24b767b9a9a46e8359f2b. | [1]https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/commit/8f062d3f661e20bb19b24b767b9a9a46e8359f2b<br>[2]https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2025-54952 |
| 2 | CVE-2025-54886 | 8.4  | HIGH | skops is a Python library which helps users share and ship their scikit-learn based models. In versions 0.12.0 and below, the Card.get_model does not contain any logic to prevent arbitrary code execution. The Card.get_model function supports both joblib and skops for model loading. When loading .skops models, it uses skops` secure loading with trusted type validation, raising errors for untrusted types unless explicitly allowed. However, when non-.zip file formats are provided, the function silently falls back to joblib without warning. Unlike skops, joblib allows arbitrary code execution during loading, bypassing security measures and potentially enabling malicious code execution. This issue is fixed in version 0.13.0. | [1]https://github.com/skops-dev/skops/commit/29d61ea8a92f2bde6830e8f32cc72a1a87211cda<br>[2]https://github.com/skops-dev/skops/security/advisories/GHSA-378x-6p4f-8jgm |
| 3 | CVE-2025-54887 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | jwe is a Ruby implementation of the RFC 7516 JSON Web Encryption (JWE) standard. In versions 1.1.0 and below, authentication tags of encrypted JWEs can be brute forced, which may result in loss of confidentiality for those JWEs and provide ways to craft arbitrary JWEs. This puts users at risk because JWEs can be modified to decrypt to an arbitrary value, decrypted by observing parsing differences and the GCM internal GHASH key can be recovered. Users are affected by this vulnerability even if they do not use an AES-GCM encryption algorithm for their JWEs. As the GHASH key may have been leaked, users must rotate the encryption keys after upgrading. This issue is fixed in version 1.1.1. | [1]https://github.com/jwt/ruby-jwe/commit/1e719d79ba3d7aadaa39a2f08c25df077a0f9ff1<br>[2]https://github.com/jwt/ruby-jwe/security/advisories/GHSA-c7p4-hx26-pr73 |

| 23 | CVE-2025-4796 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Eventin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.34. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user`s identity or capability prior to updating their details like email in the `Eventin\Speaker\Api\SpeakerController::update_item` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to change arbitrary user`s email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user`s password and gain access to their account. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-event-solution/tags/4.0.28/core/speaker/Api/SpeakerController.php#L419<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3336972/wp-event-solution/trunk/core/speaker/Api/SpeakerController.php#file0<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/9e0d441d-1da5-45e7-8a14-ce178099c0cc?source=cve |
