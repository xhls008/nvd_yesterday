| 1 | CVE-2024-4847 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Alt Text AI – Automatically generate image alt text for SEO and accessibility plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to generic SQL Injection via the ‘last_post_id’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.9 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/alttext-ai/trunk/includes/class-atai-attachment.php#L677<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3086107/<br>[3]https://wordpress.org/plugins/alttext-ai/#developers<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/3c192623-eb46-4f1d-b897-433ac80608cb?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2024-32888 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | The Amazon JDBC Driver for Redshift is a Type 4 JDBC driver that provides database connectivity through the standard JDBC application program interfaces (APIs) available in the Java Platform, Enterprise Editions. Prior to version 2.1.0.28, SQL injection is possible when using the non-default connection property `preferQueryMode=simple` in combination with application code which has a vulnerable SQL that negates a parameter value. There is no vulnerability in the driver when using the default, extended query mode. Note that `preferQueryMode` is not a supported parameter in Redshift JDBC driver, and is inherited code from Postgres JDBC driver. Users who do not override default settings to utilize this unsupported query mode are not affected. This issue is patched in driver version 2.1.0.28. As a workaround, do not use the connection property `preferQueryMode=simple`. (NOTE: Those who do not explicitly specify a query mode use the default of extended query mode and are not affected by this issue.) | [1]https://github.com/aws/amazon-redshift-jdbc-driver/commit/0d354a5f26ca23f7cac4e800e3b8734220230319<br>[2]https://github.com/aws/amazon-redshift-jdbc-driver/commit/12a5e8ecfbb44c8154fc66041cca2e20ecd7b339<br>[3]https://github.com/aws/amazon-redshift-jdbc-driver/commit/bc93694201a291493778ce5369a72befeca5ba7d<br>[4]https://github.com/aws/amazon-redshift-jdbc-driver/security/advisories/GHSA-x3wm-hffr-chwm<br>[5]https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-24rp-q3w6-vc56 |
| 3 | CVE-2024-4893 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | DigiWin EasyFlow .NET lacks validation for certain input parameters, allowing remote attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands.

| 4 | CVE-2024-4010 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Email Subscribers by Icegram Express plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data, modification of data, and loss of data due to a missing capability check on the handle_ajax_request function in all versions up to, and including, 5.7.19. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to cause a loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, by performing multiple unauthorized actions. Some of these actions could also be leveraged to conduct PHP Object Injection and SQL Injection attacks. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3083762/email-subscribers<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/23bfcdd1-b99d-47eb-9f88-96f9ecc53b32?source=cve |

| 18 | CVE-2023-5935 | 7.4  | HIGH | When configuring Arc (e.g. during the first setup), a local web interface is provided to ease the configuration process. Such web interface lacks authentication and may thus be abused by a local attacker or malware running on the machine itself.A malicious local user or process, during a window of opportunity when the local web interface is active, may be able to extract sensitive information or change Arc`s configuration.

| 23 | CVE-2024-34082 | 8.5  | HIGH | Grav is a file-based Web platform. Prior to version 1.7.46, a low privilege user account with page edit privilege can read any server files using Twig Syntax. This includes Grav user account files - `/grav/user/accounts/*.yaml`. This file stores hashed user password, 2FA secret, and the password reset token. This can allow an adversary to compromise any registered account and read any file in the web server by resetting a password for a user to get access to the password reset token from the file or by cracking the hashed password. A low privileged user may also perform a full account takeover of other registered users including Administrators. Version 1.7.46 contains a patch. | [1]https://github.com/getgrav/grav/commit/b6bba9eb99bf8cb55b8fa8d23f18873ca594e348<br>[2]https://github.com/getgrav/grav/security/advisories/GHSA-f8v5-jmfh-pr69 |
