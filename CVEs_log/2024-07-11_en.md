| 24 | CVE-2024-39518 | 7.5  | HIGH | A Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the telemetry sensor process (sensord) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX240, MX480, MX960 platforms using MPC10E causes a steady increase in memory utilization, ultimately leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).When the device is subscribed to a specific subscription on Junos Telemetry Interface, a slow memory leak occurs and eventually all resources are consumed and the device becomes unresponsive. A manual reboot of the Line Card will be required to restore the device to its normal functioning. This issue is only seen when telemetry subscription is active.The Heap memory utilization can be monitored using the following command:  > show system processes extensiveThe following command can be used to monitor the memory utilization of the specific sensor  > show system info | match sensord   PID   NAME                 MEMORY     PEAK MEMORY    %CPU   THREAD-COUNT CORE-AFFINITY   UPTIME   1986  sensord            877.57MB   877.57MB         2       4           0,2-15          7-21:41:32This issue affects Junos OS:   *  from 21.2R3-S5 before 21.2R3-S7,   *  from 21.4R3-S4 before 21.4R3-S6,   *  from 22.2R3 before 22.2R3-S4,   *  from 22.3R2 before 22.3R3-S2,   *  from 22.4R1 before 22.4R3,   *  from 23.2R1 before 23.2R2. | [1]https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA82982 |
| 25 | CVE-2024-39555 | 7.5  | HIGH | An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker sending a specific malformed BGP update message to cause the session to reset, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  Continued receipt and processing of these malformed BGP update messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.Upon receipt of a BGP update message over an established BGP session containing a specifically malformed tunnel encapsulation attribute, when segment routing is enabled, internal processing of the malformed attributes within the update results in improper parsing of remaining attributes, leading to session reset:BGP SEND Notification code 3 (Update Message Error) subcode 1 (invalid attribute list)Only systems with segment routing enabled are vulnerable to this issue.This issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations, and requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.This issue affects:Junos OS:   *  All versions before 21.4R3-S8,   *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S4,   *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S3,   *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S3,   *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S1,   *  from 23.4 before 23.4R1-S2, 23.4R2.Junos OS Evolved:   *  All versions before 21.4R3-S8-EVO,   *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S4-EVO,   *  from 22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-S3-EVO,   *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S3-EVO,   *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S1-EVO,   *  from 23.4-EVO before 23.4R1-S2-EVO, 23.4R2-EVO. | [1]https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA83015 |
| 26 | CVE-2024-39562 | 7.5  | HIGH | A Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime vulnerability the xinetd process, responsible for spawning SSH daemon (sshd) instances, of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by blocking SSH access for legitimate users.  Continued receipt of these connections will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.The issue is triggered when a high rate of concurrent SSH requests are received and terminated in a specific way, causing xinetd to crash, and leaving defunct sshd processes. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability blocks both SSH access as well as services which rely upon SSH, such as SFTP, and Netconf over SSH.Once the system is in this state, legitimate users will be unable to SSH to the device until service is manually restored.  See WORKAROUND section below.Administrators can monitor an increase in defunct sshd processes by utilizing the CLI command:  > show system processes | match sshd  root     25219 30901  0 Jul16 ?        00:00:00 [sshd] <defunct>This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved:  *  All versions prior to 21.4R3-S7-EVO  *  22.3-EVO versions prior to 22.3R2-S2-EVO, 22.3R3-S2-EVO;  *  22.4-EVO versions prior to 22.4R3-EVO;  *  23.2-EVO versions prior to 23.2R2-EVO.This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved 22.1-EVO nor 22.2-EVO. | [1]https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA75724<br>[2]https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N |
| 27 | CVE-2024-39565 | 8.8  | HIGH | An Improper Neutralization of Data within XPath Expressions (`XPath Injection`) vulnerability in J-Web shipped with Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to execute remote commands on the target device. While an administrator is logged into a J-Web session or has previously logged in and subsequently logged out of their J-Web session, the attacker can arbitrarily execute commands on the target device with the other user`s credentials. In the worst case, the attacker will have full control over the device.This issue affects Junos OS:   *  All versions before 21.2R3-S8,   *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S7,  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S4,  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S3,  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S2,  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2,  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R1-S1, 23.4R2. | [1]https://support.juniper.net/support/downloads/?p=283<br>[2]https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA83023<br>[3]https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/v4-0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P/AU:Y/R:I/V:C/RE:L/U:Amber |
