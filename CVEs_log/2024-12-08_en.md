| No. | CVE ID | Base Score | Severity | Description | References |
|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2024-11010 | 7.2  | HIGH | The FileOrganizer – Manage WordPress and Website Files plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.4 via the `default_lang` parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/fileorganizer/trunk/init.php#L222<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/fileorganizer/trunk/main/fileorganizer.php#L149<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3201635/<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/8e958653-36c4-4979-89e1-d9411a35a92a?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2024-12270 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Beautiful taxonomy filters plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the `selects[0][term]` parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.3 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/beautiful-taxonomy-filters/trunk/includes/class-beautiful-taxonomy-filters.php<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/75c9c106-d1f9-43ee-be1f-3eddec8f2529?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2024-11501 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.3 via deserialization of untrusted input from wd_gallery_$id parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/multi-gallery/tags/1.3/partials/Shortcode.php#L21<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/778f7d9b-6376-4026-a291-1fedeabe8c99?source=cve |
