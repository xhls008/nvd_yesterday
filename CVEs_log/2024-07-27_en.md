|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2024-7062 | 8.8  | HIGH | Nimble Commander suffers from a privilege escalation vulnerability due to the server (info.filesmanager.Files.PrivilegedIOHelperV2) performing improper/insufficient validation of a client’s authorization before executing an operation. Consequently, it is possible to execute system-level commands as the root user, such as changing permissions and ownership, obtaining a handle (file descriptor) of an arbitrary file, and terminating processes, among other operations. | [1]https://pentraze.com/vulnerability-reports/CVE-2024-7062/ |
| 2 | CVE-2024-41670 | 7.5  | HIGH | In the module "PayPal Official" for PrestaShop 7+ releases prior to version 6.4.2 and for PrestaShop 1.6 releases prior to version 3.18.1, a malicious customer can confirm an order even if payment is finally declined by PayPal. A logical weakness during the capture of a payment in case of disabled webhooks can be exploited to create an accepted order. This could allow a threat actor to confirm an order with a fraudulent payment support. Versions 6.4.2 and 3.18.1 contain a patch for the issue. Additionally, users enable webhooks and check they are callable. | [1]https://github.com/202ecommerce/paypal/security/advisories/GHSA-w3w3-j3mh-3354 |
| 3 | CVE-2024-41812 | 7.5  | HIGH | txtdot is an HTTP proxy that parses only text, links, and pictures from pages, removing ads and heavy scripts. Prior to version 1.7.0, a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the `/get` route of txtdot allows remote attackers to use the server as a proxy to send HTTP GET requests to arbitrary targets and retrieve information in the internal network. Version 1.7.0 prevents displaying the response of forged requests, but the requests can still be sent. For complete mitigation, a firewall between txtdot and other internal network resources should be set. | [1]https://github.com/TxtDot/txtdot/blob/a7fdaf80fdf45abefe83b2eb5135ba112142dc74/src/handlers/distributor.ts#L43-L47<br>[2]https://github.com/TxtDot/txtdot/commit/7c72d985f7a26ec1fd3cf628444717ca54986d2d<br>[3]https://github.com/TxtDot/txtdot/security/advisories/GHSA-4gj5-xj97-j8fp |
| 4 | CVE-2024-41813 | 7.5  | HIGH | txtdot is an HTTP proxy that parses only text, links, and pictures from pages, removing ads and heavy scripts. Starting in version 1.4.0 and prior to version 1.6.1, a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the `/proxy` route of txtdot allows remote attackers to use the server as a proxy to send HTTP GET requests to arbitrary targets and retrieve information in the internal network. Version 1.6.1 patches the issue. | [1]https://github.com/TxtDot/txtdot/blob/a7fdaf80fdf45abefe83b2eb5135ba112142dc74/src/handlers/distributor.ts#L43-L47<br>[2]https://github.com/TxtDot/txtdot/commit/f241a46e05b148a39b84bf956051b5aaa489949e<br>[3]https://github.com/TxtDot/txtdot/security/advisories/GHSA-4c78-229v-hf6m |

| 7 | CVE-2024-39304 | 8.8  | HIGH | ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. Versions of the application prior to 5.9.2 are vulnerable to an authenticated SQL injection due to an improper sanitization of user input. Authentication is required, but no elevated privileges are necessary. This allows attackers to inject SQL statements directly into the database query due to inadequate sanitization of the EID parameter in in a GET request to `/GetText.php`. Version 5.9.2 patches the issue. | [1]https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/commit/e3bd7bfbf33f01148df0ef1acdb0cf2c2b878b08<br>[2]https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/security/advisories/GHSA-2rh6-gr3h-83j9 |
