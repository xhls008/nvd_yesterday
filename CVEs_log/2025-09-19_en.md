| 1 | CVE-2023-49564 | 8.8  | HIGH | The CBIS/NCS Manager API is vulnerable to an authentication bypass. By sending a specially crafted HTTP header, an unauthenticated user can gain unauthorized access to API functions. This flaw allows attackers to reach restricted or sensitive endpoints of the HTTP API without providing any valid credentials. The root cause of this vulnerability lies in a weak verification mechanism within the authentication implementation present in the Nginx Podman container on the CBIS/NCS Manager host machine.The risk can be partially mitigated by restricting access to the management network using external firewall. | [1]https://www.nokia.com/about-us/security-and-privacy/product-security-advisory/CVE-2023-49564/ |
| 2 | CVE-2023-49565 | 8.4  | HIGH | The cbis_manager Podman container is vulnerable to remote command execution via the /api/plugins endpoint. Improper sanitization of the HTTP Headers X-FILENAME, X-PAGE, and X-FIELD allows for command injection. These headers are directly utilized within the subprocess.Popen Python function without adequate validation, enabling a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying system by crafting malicious header values within an HTTP request to the affected endpoint.The web service executes with root privileges within the container environment, the demonstrated remote code execution permits an attacker to acquire elevated privileges for the command execution.Restricting access to the management network with an external firewall can partially mitigate this risk. | [1]https://www.nokia.com/about-us/security-and-privacy/product-security-advisory/CVE-2023-49565/ |

| 19 | CVE-2025-59424 | 7.3  | HIGH | LinkAce is a self-hosted archive to collect website links. Prior to 2.3.1, a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified on the /system/audit page. The application fails to properly sanitize the username field before it is rendered in the audit log. An authenticated attacker can set a malicious JavaScript payload as their username.

The script is then executed in the browser of any user, particularly administrators, who views the /system/audit page. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.3.1. | [1]https://github.com/Kovah/LinkAce/commit/c0d21b974b32f1ca2fab550fb476c573a068e196<br>[2]https://github.com/Kovah/LinkAce/security/advisories/GHSA-289g-9gff-p4wh |
