| 18 | CVE-2025-54591 | 7.5  | HIGH | FreshRSS is a free, self-hostable RSS aggregator. Versions 1.26.3 and below expose information about feeds and tags of default admin users, due to lack of access checking in the FreshRSS_Auth::hasAccess() function used by some of the tag/feed related endpoints. FreshRSS controllers usually have a defined firstAction() method with an override to make sure that every action requires access. If one doesn`t, then every action has to check for access manually, and certain endpoints use neither the firstAction() method, or do they perform a manual access check. This issue is fixed in version 1.27.0. | [1]https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/pull/7768<br>[2]https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/releases/tag/1.27.0<br>[3]https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/security/advisories/GHSA-jf4v-f8p2-8xvq |

| 22 | CVE-2025-59942 | 7.5  | HIGH | go-f3 is a Golang implementation of Fast Finality for Filecoin (F3). In versions 0.8.6 and below, go-f3 panics when it validates a "poison" messages causing Filecoin nodes consuming F3 messages to become vulnerable. A "poison" message can can cause integer overflow in the signer index validation, which can cause the whole node to crash. These malicious messages aren`t self-propagating since the bug is in the validator. An attacker needs to directly send the message to all targets. This issue is fixed in version 0.8.7. | [1]https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-f3/security/advisories/GHSA-g99p-47x7-mq88 |
