| 8 | CVE-2025-12974 | 8.1  | HIGH | The Gravity Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the legacy chunked upload mechanism in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.21.1. This is due to the extension blacklist not including .phar files, which can be uploaded through the chunked upload mechanism. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload executable .phar files and achieve remote code execution on the server, granted they can discover or enumerate the upload path. In order for an attacker to achieve RCE, the web server needs to be set up to process .phar file as PHP via file handler mapping or similar. | [1]https://docs.gravityforms.com/gravityforms-change-log/<br>[2]https://github.com/pronamic/gravityforms/blob/06de1b7e169e4f073e9d0d491e17b89365b48c20/common/common.php#L4178<br>[3]https://github.com/pronamic/gravityforms/blob/06de1b7e169e4f073e9d0d491e17b89365b48c20/includes/upload.php#L97<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b6395439-da45-4b64-8e30-b106dffd46c1?source=cve |

| 10 | CVE-2025-10089 | 7.0  | HIGH | Uncontrolled Search Path Element Vulnerability in Setting and Operation Application for Lighting Control System MILCO.S Setting Application all versions, MILCO.S Setting Application (IR) all versions, MILCO.S Easy Setting Application (IR) all versions, and MILCO.S Easy Switch Application (IR) all versions allows a local attacker to execute malicious code by having installer to load a malicious DLL. However, if the signer name "Mitsubishi Electric Lighting" appears on the "Digital Signatures" tab of the properties for "MILCO.S Lighting Control.exe", the application is a fixed one. This vulnerability only affects when the installer is run, not after installation. If a user downloads directly from Mitsubishi Electric website and installs the affected product, there is no risk of malicious code being introduced. | [1]https://jvn.jp/vu/JVNVU97181602/<br>[2]https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2025-015_en.pdf |

| 13 | CVE-2025-11620 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Multiple Roles per User plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the `mrpu_add_multiple_roles_ui` and `mrpu_save_multiple_user_roles` functions in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, granted the `edit_users` capability, to edit any user`s role, including promoting users to Administrator and demoting Administrators to lower-privileged roles. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/multiple-roles-per-user/trunk/multiple-roles-per-user.php#L121<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/multiple-roles-per-user/trunk/multiple-roles-per-user.php#L54<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/30741601-50b9-4799-a340-11f6ffa59553?source=cve |
| 14 | CVE-2025-12411 | 7.1  | HIGH | The Premmerce Wholesale Pricing for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the `ID` parameter in versions up to, and including, 1.1.10. This is due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber level access and above, to manipulate SQL queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database and modify price type display names in the database via the admin-post.php "premmerce_update_price_type" action, causing cosmetic corruption of the admin interface. The `price_type` parameter of the "premmerce_delete_price_type" is also vulnerable. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/premmerce-woocommerce-wholesale-pricing/tags/1.1.10/src/Admin/Admin.php#L83<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/premmerce-woocommerce-wholesale-pricing/tags/1.1.10/src/Models/Model.php#L171<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/1e4e27e0-bbb0-498a-b425-9e9d60dfed0f?source=cve |
| 15 | CVE-2025-12528 | 8.1  | HIGH | The Pie Forms for WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Upload in all versions up to, and including, 1.6 via the format_classic function. This is due to insufficient file type validation where the validate_classic method validates file extensions and sets error messages but does not prevent the file upload process from continuing. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload files with dangerous extensions such as PHP, which makes remote code execution possible. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to guess the directory in which the file is placed (which is a somewhat predictable hash). In addition to that, the file name is generated using a secure hash method, limiting the exploitability of this vulnerability. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/pie-forms-for-wp/tags/1.6/includes/fields/fileupload.php#L18<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/pie-forms-for-wp/tags/1.6/includes/fields/fileupload.php#L331<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/pie-forms-for-wp/tags/1.6/includes/fields/fileupload.php#L475<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/4941a0ce-67f1-430d-bbad-3c97a4ed449e?source=cve |
| 16 | CVE-2025-12775 | 8.8  | HIGH | The WP Dropzone plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authenticated arbitrary file upload in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0 via the `ajax_upload_handle` function. This is due to the chunked upload functionality writing files directly to the uploads directory before any file type validation occurs. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-dropzone/tags/1.1.0/includes/class-plugin.php#L127<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-dropzone/tags/1.1.0/includes/class-plugin.php#L88<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3395966%40wp-dropzone&new=3395966%40wp-dropzone&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/afd7aeb7-2c6f-4b23-b8b1-52fb010e5aac?source=cve |
| 17 | CVE-2025-13088 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Category and Product Woocommerce Tabs plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to insufficient input validation on the `template` parameter in the categoryProductTab() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary .php files on the server. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/category-and-product-woocommerce-tabs/tags/1.0/include/wccategorytab.php#L108<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c3938bbb-dc3d-4550-a05d-0cde970e38f8?source=cve |

| 21 | CVE-2025-12955 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Live sales notification for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.39. This is due to the "getOrders" function lacking proper authorization and capability checks when the plugin is configured to display recent order information. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive customer information including buyer first names, city, state, country, purchase time and date, and product details. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3394241%40live-sales-notifications-for-woocommerce&old=3389540%40live-sales-notifications-for-woocommerce&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/1cebcf16-ae7f-45c4-8e1d-80ede4c32106?source=cve |
| 22 | CVE-2025-13069 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Enable SVG, WebP, and ICO Upload plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file upload in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.2. This is due to insufficient file type validation detecting ICO files, allowing double extension files with the appropriate magic bytes to bypass sanitization while being accepted as a valid ICO file. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://wordpress.org/plugins/enable-svg-webp-ico-upload/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/5716c4e1-a6d3-42e8-b90c-d16f204c8503?source=cve |
| 23 | CVE-2025-4212 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Checkout Files Upload for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via file uploads in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

| 30 | CVE-2025-6670 | 8.8  | HIGH | A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in multiple WSO2 products due to the use of the HTTP GET method for state-changing operations within admin services, specifically in the event processor of the Carbon console. Although the SameSite=Lax cookie attribute is used as a mitigation, it is ineffective in this context because it allows cookies to be sent with cross-origin top-level navigations using GET requests.A malicious actor can exploit this vulnerability by tricking an authenticated user into visiting a crafted link, leading the browser to issue unintended state-changing requests. Successful exploitation could result in unauthorized operations such as data modification, account changes, or other administrative actions. According to WSO2 Secure Production Guidelines, exposure of Carbon console services to untrusted networks is discouraged, which may reduce the impact in properly secured deployments. | [1]https://security.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/security-announcements/security-advisories/2025/WSO2-2025-4117/ |
| 31 | CVE-2025-9312 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | A missing authentication enforcement vulnerability exists in the mutual TLS (mTLS) implementation used by System REST APIs and SOAP services in multiple WSO2 products. Due to improper validation of client certificate–based authentication in certain default configurations, the affected components may permit unauthenticated requests even when mTLS is enabled. This condition occurs when relying on the default mTLS settings for System REST APIs or when the mTLS authenticator is enabled for SOAP services, causing these interfaces to accept requests without enforcing additional authentication.Successful exploitation allows a malicious actor with network access to the affected endpoints to gain administrative privileges and perform unauthorized operations. The vulnerability is exploitable only when the impacted mTLS flows are enabled and accessible in a given deployment. Other certificate-based authentication mechanisms such as Mutual TLS OAuth client authentication and X.509 login flows are not affected, and APIs served through the API Gateway of WSO2 API Manager remain unaffected. | [1]https://security.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/security-announcements/security-advisories/2025/WSO2-2025-4494/ |
| 32 | CVE-2025-63602 | 7.3  | HIGH | A vulnerability was discovered in Awesome Miner thru 11.2.4 that allows arbitrary read and write to kernel memory and MSRs (such as LSTAR) as an unprivileged user. This is due to the implementation of an insecure version of WinRing0 (1.2.0.5, renamed to IntelliBreeze.Maintenance.Service.sys) that lacks a properly secured DACL, allowing unprivileged users to interact with the driver and, as a result, the kernel. This can result in local privilege escalation, information disclosure, denial of service, and other unspecified impacts. | [1]https://dreadsec.co/p/cve-2025-63602-hijacking-system-calls-with-a-popular-crypto-miner.html<br>[2]https://www.awesomeminer.com/download |
| 33 | CVE-2025-63800 | 7.5  | HIGH | The password change endpoint in Open Source Point of Sale 3.4.1 allows users to set their account password to an empty string due to missing server-side validation. When an authenticated user omits or leaves the `password` and `repeat_password` parameters empty in the password change request, the backend still returns a successful response and sets the password to an empty string. This effectively disables authentication and may allow unauthorized access to user or administrative accounts. | [1]https://github.com/omkaryepre/vulnerability-research/tree/main/CVE-2025-63800<br>[2]https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos<br>[3]https://opensourcepos.org/ |

| 44 | CVE-2025-64076 | 7.5  | HIGH | Multiple vulnerabilities exist in cbor2 through version 5.7.0 in the decode_definite_long_string() function of the C extension decoder (source/decoder.c): (1) Integer Underflow Leading to Out-of-Bounds Read (CWE-191, CWE-125): An incorrect variable reference and missing state reset in the chunk processing loop causes buffer_length to not be reset to zero after UTF-8 character consumption. This results in subsequent chunk_length calculations producing negative values (e.g., chunk_length = 65536 - buffer_length), which are passed as signed integers to the read() method, potentially triggering unlimited read operations and resource exhaustion. (2) Memory Leak via Missing Reference Count Release (CWE-401): The main processing loop fails to release Python object references (Py_DECREF) for chunk objects allocated in each iteration. For CBOR strings longer than 65536 bytes, this causes cumulative memory leaks proportional to the payload size, enabling memory exhaustion attacks through repeated processing of large CBOR payloads. Both vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely without authentication by sending specially-crafted CBOR data containing definite-length text strings with multi-byte UTF-8 characters positioned at 65536-byte chunk boundaries. Successful exploitation results in denial of service through process crashes (CBORDecodeEOF exceptions) or memory exhaustion. The vulnerabilities affect all applications using cbor2`s C extension to process untrusted CBOR data, including web APIs, IoT data collectors, and message queue processors. Fixed in commit 851473490281f82d82560b2368284ef33cf6e8f9 pushed with released version 5.7.1. | [1]https://github.com/agronholm/cbor2/commit/851473490281f82d82560b2368284ef33cf6e8f9<br>[2]https://github.com/agronholm/cbor2/issues/264<br>[3]https://github.com/agronholm/cbor2/pull/265 |

| 49 | CVE-2025-62406 | 8.1  | HIGH | Piwigo is a full featured open source photo gallery application for the web. In Piwigo 15.6.0, using the password reset function allows sending a password-reset URL by entering an existing username or email address. However, the hostname used to construct this URL is taken from the HTTP request`s Host header and is not validated at all. Therefore, an attacker can send a password-reset URL with a modified hostname to an existing user whose username or email the attacker knows or guesses. This issue has been patched in version 15.7.0. | [1]https://github.com/Piwigo/Piwigo/commit/9d2565465efc3570963ff431b45cad21610f6692<br>[2]https://github.com/Piwigo/Piwigo/security/advisories/GHSA-9986-w7jf-33f6 |
