| 202 | CVE-2025-27421 | 7.5  | HIGH | Abacus is a highly scalable and stateless counting API. A critical goroutine leak vulnerability has been identified in the Abacus server`s Server-Sent Events (SSE) implementation. The issue occurs when clients disconnect from the /stream endpoint, as the server fails to properly clean up resources and terminate associated goroutines. This leads to resource exhaustion where the server continues running but eventually stops accepting new SSE connections while maintaining high memory usage. The vulnerability specifically involves improper channel cleanup in the event handling mechanism, causing goroutines to remain blocked indefinitely. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.0. | [1]https://github.com/JasonLovesDoggo/abacus/commit/898ff1204e11317cc161240b660e63eed5a72b33<br>[2]https://github.com/JasonLovesDoggo/abacus/security/advisories/GHSA-vh64-54px-qgf8 |

| 204 | CVE-2025-27423 | 7.1  | HIGH | Vim is an open source, command line text editor. Vim is distributed with the tar.vim plugin, that allows easy editing and viewing of (compressed or uncompressed) tar files. Starting with 9.1.0858, the tar.vim plugin uses the ":read" ex command line to append below the cursor position, however the is not sanitized and is taken literally from the tar archive. This allows to execute shell commands via special crafted tar archives. Whether this really happens, depends on the shell being used (`shell` option, which is set using $SHELL). The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.1164 | [1]https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/129a8446d23cd9cb4445fcfea259cba5e0487d29<br>[2]https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/334a13bff78aa0ad206bc436885f63e3a0bab399<br>[3]https://github.com/vim/vim/security/advisories/GHSA-wfmf-8626-q3r3 |
| 205 | CVE-2025-27500 | 8.2  | HIGH | OpenZiti is a free and open source project focused on bringing zero trust to any application. An endpoint(/api/upload) on the admin panel can be accessed without any form of authentication. This endpoint accepts an HTTP POST to upload a file which is then stored on the node and is available via URL. This can lead to a stored cross site scripting attack if the file uploaded contains malicious code and is then accessed and executed within the context of the user`s browser. This function is no longer necessary as the ziti-console moves from a node server application to a single page application, and has been disabled. The vulnerability is fixed in 3.7.1. | [1]https://github.com/openziti/ziti-console/security/advisories/GHSA-frxm-vm48-5qf2 |
| 206 | CVE-2025-27501 | 8.6  | HIGH | OpenZiti is a free and open source project focused on bringing zero trust to any application. An endpoint on the admin panel can be accessed without any form of authentication. This endpoint accepts a user-supplied URL parameter to connect to an OpenZiti Controller and performs a server-side request, resulting in a potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. The fixed version has moved the request to the external controller from the server side to the client side, thereby eliminating the identity of the node from being used to gain any additional permissions.
