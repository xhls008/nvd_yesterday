(CWE-918)  Hitachi Vantara Pentaho Business Analytics Server versions before 10.2.0.0 and 9.3.0.9, including 8.3.x, do not validate the Host header of incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests. By providing URLs to unexpected hosts or ports, attackers can make it appear that the server is sending the request, possibly bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly. The server can be used as a proxy to conduct port scanning of hosts in internal networks, use other URLs such as that can access documents on the system (using file://), or use other protocols such as gopher:// or tftp://, which may provide greater control over the contents of requests. | [1]https://support.pentaho.com/hc/en-us/articles/34296789835917--Resolved-Hitachi-Vantara-Pentaho-Business-Analytics-Server-Server-Side-Request-Forgery-Versions-before-10-2-0-0-and-9-3-0-9-including-8-3-x-Impacted-CVE-2024-37359 |

(CWE-863)   Hitachi Vantara Pentaho Business Analytics Server versions before 10.2.0.0 and 9.3.0.9, including 8.3.x, have modules enabled by default that allow execution of system level processes.  When access control checks are incorrectly applied, users can access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures and denial of service. | [1]https://support.pentaho.com/hc/en-us/articles/34296615099405--Resolved-Hitachi-Vantara-Pentaho-Business-Analytics-Server-Incorrect-Authorization-Versions-before-10-2-0-0-and-9-3-0-9-including-8-3-x-Impacted-CVE-2024-5705 |
