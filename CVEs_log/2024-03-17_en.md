| 21 | CVE-2024-28252 | 7.5  | HIGH | CoreWCF is a port of the service side of Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) to .NET Core. If you have a NetFraming based CoreWCF service, extra system resources could be consumed by connections being left established instead of closing or aborting them. There are two scenarios when this can happen. When a client established a connection to the service and sends no data, the service will wait indefinitely for the client to initiate the NetFraming session handshake. Additionally, once a client has established a session, if the client doesn`t send any requests for the period of time configured in the binding ReceiveTimeout, the connection is not properly closed as part of the session being aborted. The bindings affected by this behavior are NetTcpBinding, NetNamedPipeBinding, and UnixDomainSocketBinding. Only NetTcpBinding has the ability to accept non local connections. The currently supported versions of CoreWCF are v1.4.x and v1.5.x. The fix can be found in v1.4.2 and v1.5.3 of the CoreWCF packages. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no workarounds for this issue. | [1]https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF/issues/1345<br>[2]https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF/security/advisories/GHSA-32jq-mv89-5rx7 |
| 22 | CVE-2024-28854 | 7.5  | HIGH | tls-listener is a rust lang wrapper around a connection listener to support TLS. With the default configuration of tls-listener, a malicious user can open 6.4 `TcpStream`s a second, sending 0 bytes, and can trigger a DoS. The default configuration options make any public service using `TlsListener::new()` vulnerable to a slow-loris DoS attack. This impacts any publicly accessible service using the default configuration of tls-listener in versions prior to 0.10.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this by passing a large value, such as `usize::MAX` as the parameter to `Builder::max_handshakes`. | [1]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowloris_computer_security |
| 23 | CVE-2024-27920 | 7.4  | HIGH | projectdiscovery/nuclei is a fast and customisable vulnerability scanner based on simple YAML based DSL. A significant security oversight was identified in Nuclei v3, involving the execution of unsigned code templates through workflows. This vulnerability specifically affects users utilizing custom workflows, potentially allowing the execution of malicious code on the user`s system. This advisory outlines the impacted users, provides details on the security patch, and suggests mitigation strategies. The vulnerability is addressed in Nuclei v3.2.0. Users are strongly recommended to update to this version to mitigate the security risk. Users should refrain from using custom workflows if unable to upgrade immediately. Only trusted, verified workflows should be executed. | [1]https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/templates/protocols/code<br>[2]https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/templates/reference/template-signing<br>[3]https://docs.projectdiscovery.io/templates/workflows/overview<br>[4]https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/pull/4822<br>[5]https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/security/advisories/GHSA-w5wx-6g2r-r78q |
| 24 | CVE-2024-28253 | 9.4  | CRITICAL | OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery, observability, and governance powered by a central metadata repository, in-depth lineage, and seamless team collaboration. `CompiledRule::validateExpression` is also called from `PolicyRepository.prepare`. `prepare()` is called from `EntityRepository.prepareInternal()` which, in turn, gets called from `EntityResource.createOrUpdate()`. Note that even though there is an authorization check (`authorizer.authorize()`), it gets called after `prepareInternal()` gets called and therefore after the SpEL expression has been evaluated. In order to reach this method, an attacker can send a PUT request to `/api/v1/policies` which gets handled by `PolicyResource.createOrUpdate()`. This vulnerability was discovered with the help of CodeQL`s Expression language injection (Spring) query and is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-252`. This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution and has been addressed in version 1.3.1. Users are advised to upgrade.

| 25 | CVE-2024-28254 | 8.8  | HIGH | OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery, observability, and governance powered by a central metadata repository, in-depth lineage, and seamless team collaboration. The `‎AlertUtil::validateExpression` method evaluates an SpEL expression using `getValue` which by default uses the `StandardEvaluationContext`, allowing the expression to reach and interact with Java classes such as `java.lang.Runtime`, leading to Remote Code Execution. The `/api/v1/events/subscriptions/validation/condition/<expression>` endpoint passes user-controlled data `AlertUtil::validateExpession` allowing authenticated (non-admin) users to execute arbitrary system commands on the underlaying operating system. In addition, there is a missing authorization check since `Authorizer.authorize()` is never called in the affected path and, therefore, any authenticated non-admin user is able to trigger this endpoint and evaluate arbitrary SpEL expressions leading to arbitrary command execution. This vulnerability was discovered with the help of CodeQL`s Expression language injection (Spring) query and is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-235`. This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution and has been addressed in version 1.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/java/java-spel-expression-injection<br>[2]https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/84054a85d3478e3e3795fe92daa633ec11c9d6d9/openmetadata-service/src/main/java/org/openmetadata/service/events/subscription/AlertUtil.java#L101<br>[3]https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/84054a85d3478e3e3795fe92daa633ec11c9d6d9/openmetadata-service/src/main/java/org/openmetadata/service/events/subscription/AlertUtil.java#L108<br>[4]https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/security/advisories/GHSA-j86m-rrpr-g8gw<br>[5]https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/4e2d3573189b7c0afce62bce29cd915de4077f56/spring-expression/src/main/java/org/springframework/expression/spel/standard/SpelExpression.java#L106 |
| 26 | CVE-2024-28255 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery, observability, and governance powered by a central metadata repository, in-depth lineage, and seamless team collaboration. The `JwtFilter` handles the API authentication by requiring and verifying JWT tokens. When a new request comes in, the request`s path is checked against this list. When the request`s path contains any of the excluded endpoints the filter returns without validating the JWT. Unfortunately, an attacker may use Path Parameters to make any path contain any arbitrary strings. For example, a request to `GET /api/v1;v1%2fusers%2flogin/events/subscriptions/validation/condition/111` will match the excluded endpoint condition and therefore will be processed with no JWT validation allowing an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and reach any arbitrary endpoint, including the ones listed above that lead to arbitrary SpEL expression injection. This bypass will not work when the endpoint uses the `SecurityContext.getUserPrincipal()` since it will return `null` and will throw an NPE. This issue may lead to authentication bypass and has been addressed in version 1.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-237`. | [1]https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/e2043a3f31312ebb42391d6c93a67584d798de52/openmetadata-service/src/main/java/org/openmetadata/service/security/JwtFilter.java#L111<br>[2]https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/e2043a3f31312ebb42391d6c93a67584d798de52/openmetadata-service/src/main/java/org/openmetadata/service/security/JwtFilter.java#L113<br>[3]https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/security/advisories/GHSA-6wx7-qw5p-wh84 |
