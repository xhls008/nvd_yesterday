| 4 | CVE-2025-11849 | 9.3  | CRITICAL | Versions of the package mammoth from 0.3.25 and before 1.11.0; versions of the package mammoth from 0.3.25 and before 1.11.0; versions of the package mammoth before 1.11.0; versions of the package org.zwobble.mammoth:mammoth before 1.11.0 are vulnerable to Directory Traversal due to the lack of path or file type validation when processing a docx file containing an image with an external link (r:link attribute instead of embedded r:embed). The library resolves the URI to a file path and after reading, the content is encoded as base64 and included in the HTML output as a data URI. An attacker can read arbitrary files on the system where the conversion is performed or cause an excessive resources consumption by crafting a docx file that links to special device files such as /dev/random or /dev/zero. | [1]https://gist.github.com/AudunWA/4d690d9ae5efdafe7cf71d9c2ee90a10<br>[2]https://github.com/mwilliamson/mammoth.js/commit/c54aaeb43a7941317c1f3c119ffa92090f988820<br>[3]https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-DOTNET-MAMMOTH-13561968<br>[4]https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGZWOBBLEMAMMOTH-13561969<br>[5]https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-MAMMOTH-13554470<br>[6]https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-MAMMOTH-13561967<br>[7]https://gist.github.com/AudunWA/4d690d9ae5efdafe7cf71d9c2ee90a10 |

| 9 | CVE-2025-59043 | 7.5  | HIGH | OpenBao is an open source identity-based secrets management system. In OpenBao versions prior to 2.4.1, JSON objects after decoding may use significantly more memory than their serialized version. It is possible to craft a JSON payload to maximize the factor between serialized memory usage and deserialized memory usage, similar to a zip bomb, with factors reaching approximately 35. This can be used to circumvent the max_request_size configuration parameter which is intended to protect against denial of service attacks. The request body is parsed into a map very early in the request handling chain before authentication, which means an unauthenticated attacker can send a specifically crafted JSON object and cause an out-of-memory crash. Additionally, for requests with large numbers of strings, the audit subsystem can consume large quantities of CPU. The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.4.1. | [1]https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/788536bd3e10818a7b4fb00aac6affc23388e5a9/http/logical.go#L50<br>[2]https://github.com/openbao/openbao/commit/d418f238bc99adc72c73109faf574cc2b672880c<br>[3]https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/1756<br>[4]https://github.com/openbao/openbao/security/advisories/GHSA-g46h-2rq9-gw5m |
| 10 | CVE-2025-60279 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | A server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Illia Cloud illia-Builder before v4.8.5 allows authenticated users to send arbitrary requests to internal services via the API. An attacker can leverage this to enumerate open ports based on response discrepancies and interact with internal services. | [1]https://github.com/lukehebe/Vulnerability-Disclosures/blob/main/CVE-2025-60279.pdf<br>[2]https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Server_Side_Request_Forgery |
| 11 | CVE-2025-62353 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | A path traversal vulnerability in all versions of the Windsurf IDE enables a threat actor to read and write arbitrary local files in and outside of current projects on an end user’s system. The vulnerability can be reached directly and through indirect prompt injection. | [1]https://hiddenlayer.com/sai_security_advisor/2025-10-windsurf/ |
| 12 | CVE-2025-62356 | 7.5  | HIGH | A path traversal vulnerability in all versions of the Qodo Qodo Gen IDE enables a threat actor to read arbitrary local files in and outside of current projects on an end user’s system.

| 13 | CVE-2025-62168 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. In Squid versions prior to 7.2, a failure to redact HTTP authentication credentials in error handling allows information disclosure. The vulnerability allows a script to bypass browser security protections and learn the credentials a trusted client uses to authenticate. This potentially allows a remote client to identify security tokens or credentials used internally by a web application using Squid for backend load balancing. These attacks do not require Squid to be configured with HTTP authentication. The vulnerability is fixed in version 7.2. As a workaround, disable debug information in administrator mailto links generated by Squid by configuring squid.conf with email_err_data off. | [1]https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/commit/0951a0681011dfca3d78c84fd7f1e19c78a4443f<br>[2]https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/security/advisories/GHSA-c8cc-phh7-xmxr |
| 14 | CVE-2025-56221 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | A lack of rate limiting in the login mechanism of SigningHub v8.6.8 allows attackers to bypass authentication via a brute force attack. | [1]https://github.com/saykino/CVE-2025-56221 |
| 15 | CVE-2025-62515 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | pyquokka is a framework for making data lakes work for time series. In versions 0.3.1 and prior, the FlightServer class directly uses pickle.loads() to deserialize action bodies received from Flight clients without any sanitization or validation in the do_action() method. The vulnerable code is located in pyquokka/flight.py at line 283 where arbitrary data from Flight clients is directly passed to pickle.loads(). When FlightServer is configured to listen on 0.0.0.0, this allows attackers across the entire network to perform arbitrary remote code execution by sending malicious pickled payloads through the set_configs action. Additional vulnerability points exist in the cache_garbage_collect, do_put, and do_get functions where pickle.loads is used to deserialize untrusted remote data. | [1]https://github.com/marsupialtail/quokka/security/advisories/GHSA-f74j-gffq-vm9p |
