| 1 | CVE-2025-54594 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | react-native-bottom-tabs is a library of Native Bottom Tabs for React Native. In versions 0.9.2 and below, the github/workflows/release-canary.yml GitHub Actions repository workflow improperly used the pull_request_target event trigger, which allowed for untrusted code from a forked pull request to be executed in a privileged context. An attacker could create a pull request containing a malicious preinstall script in the package.json file and then trigger the vulnerable workflow by posting a specific comment (!canary). This allowed for arbitrary code execution, leading to the exfiltration of sensitive secrets such as GITHUB_TOKEN and NPM_TOKEN, and could have allowed an attacker to push malicious code to the repository or publish compromised packages to the NPM registry. There is a remediation commit which removes github/workflows/release-canary.yml, but a version with this fix has yet to be released. | [1]https://callstack.notion.site/Post-Incident-Security-Measures-GitHub-Actions-Workflow-Vulnerability-2405d027c0f8804ab7f7cdfb43366a31<br>[2]https://github.com/callstackincubator/react-native-bottom-tabs/commit/9e1c9c61d742c435ac5e0901b7e0c9249b9fc70c<br>[3]https://github.com/callstackincubator/react-native-bottom-tabs/security/advisories/GHSA-588g-38p4-gr6x |
