| 1 | CVE-2025-8060 | 8.8  | HIGH | A vulnerability has been found in Tenda AC23 16.03.07.52 and classified as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is the function sub_46C940 of the file /goform/setMacFilterCfg of the component httpd. The manipulation of the argument deviceList leads to stack-based buffer overflow. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. | [1]https://github.com/Thir0th/Thir0th-CVE/blob/main/Tenda%20AC23_V16.03.07.52_has_a_stack_overflow.md<br>[2]https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.317317<br>[3]https://vuldb.com/?id.317317<br>[4]https://vuldb.com/?submit.619604<br>[5]https://www.tenda.com.cn/<br>[6]https://github.com/Thir0th/Thir0th-CVE/blob/main/Tenda%20AC23_V16.03.07.52_has_a_stack_overflow.md |
| 2 | CVE-2025-6190 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Realty Portal – Agent plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to missing authorization within the rp_user_profile() AJAX handler in versions 0.1.0 through 0.3.9. The handler reads the client-supplied meta key and value pairs from $_POST and passes them directly to update_user_meta() without restricting to a safe whitelist. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to overwrite the wp_capabilities meta and grant themselves the administrator role. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/realty-portal-agent/trunk/includes/class-agent-process.php#L494<br>[2]https://wordpress.org/plugins/realty-portal-agent/<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b3adfe9e-ebdf-4a50-b60f-03a606a84ec0?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2025-7722 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Social Streams plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user`s identity prior to updating their user meta information in the update_user_meta() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to change their user type to that of an administrator. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/social-streams/trunk/src/php/JsonAPI.php#275<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/f3f01b88-6f93-4ee8-8d59-9165ebcd4dd1?source=cve |

| 7 | CVE-2025-8022 | 8.8  | HIGH | All versions of the package bun are vulnerable to Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (`OS Command Injection`) in the $ shell API due to improper neutralization of user input. An attacker can exploit this by providing specially crafted input that includes command-line arguments or shell metacharacters, leading to unintended command execution. | [1]https://gist.github.com/lirantal/9780d664037f29d5277d7b2bc569d213<br>[2]https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-BUN-9510752 |

| 38 | CVE-2025-6018 | 7.8  | HIGH | A Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) vulnerability has been discovered in pam-config within Linux Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM). This flaw allows an unprivileged local attacker (for example, a user logged in via SSH) to obtain the elevated privileges normally reserved for a physically present, "allow_active" user. The highest risk is that the attacker can then perform all allow_active yes Polkit actions, which are typically restricted to console users, potentially gaining unauthorized control over system configurations, services, or other sensitive operations. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-6018<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2372693<br>[3]https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1243226<br>[4]https://cdn2.qualys.com/2025/06/17/suse15-pam-udisks-lpe.txt<br>[5]https://cdn2.qualys.com/2025/06/17/suse15-pam-udisks-lpe.txt |

| 41 | CVE-2025-8069 | 7.8  | HIGH | During the AWS Client VPN client installation on Windows devices, the install process references the C:\usr\local\windows-x86_64-openssl-localbuild\ssl directory location to fetch the OpenSSL configuration file. As a result, a non-admin user could place arbitrary code in the configuration file. If an admin user starts the AWS Client VPN client installation process, that code could be executed with root-level privileges. This issue does not affect Linux or Mac devices. We recommend users discontinue any new installations of AWS Client VPN on Windows prior to version 5.2.2. | [1]https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2025-014/ |

| 45 | CVE-2025-47281 | 7.7  | HIGH | Kyverno is a policy engine designed for cloud native platform engineering teams. In versions 1.14.1 and below, a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists due to improper handling of JMESPath variable substitutions. Attackers with permissions to create or update Kyverno policies can craft expressions using the {{@}} variable combined with a pipe and an invalid JMESPath function (e.g., {{@ | non_existent_function }}). This leads to a nil value being substituted into the policy structure. Subsequent processing by internal functions, specifically getValueAsStringMap, which expect string values, results in a panic due to a type assertion failure (interface {} is nil, not string). This crashes Kyverno worker threads in the admission controller and causes continuous crashes of the reports controller pod. This is fixed in version 1.14.2. | [1]https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/commit/cbd7d4ca24de1c55396fc3295e9fc3215832be7c<br>[2]https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/security/advisories/GHSA-r5p3-955p-5ggq<br>[3]https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/security/advisories/GHSA-r5p3-955p-5ggq |

In versions 0.5.50 and below, there is a traffic-induced memory leak that can starve the process of memory, leading to loss of visibility. To workaround this issue, set `suricata.yaml app-layer.protocols.http.libhtp.default-config.lzma-enabled` to false. This issue is fixed in version 0.5.51. | [1]https://github.com/OISF/libhtp/commit/9037ea35110a0d97be5cedf8d31fb4cd9a38c7a7<br>[2]https://github.com/OISF/libhtp/security/advisories/GHSA-v3qq-h8mh-vph7 |
| 47 | CVE-2025-54377 | 7.8  | HIGH | Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent that lives in users` editors. In versions 3.23.18 and below, RooCode does not validate line breaks (\n) in its command input, allowing potential bypass of the allow-list mechanism. The project appears to lack parsing or validation logic to prevent multi-line command injection. When commands are evaluated for execution, only the first line or token may be considered, enabling attackers to smuggle additional commands in subsequent lines. This is fixed in version 3.23.19. | [1]https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/commit/9d434c2db9b20eb5c78b698cb2b0037cd2074534<br>[2]https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/security/advisories/GHSA-p278-52x9-cffx<br>[3]https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/security/advisories/GHSA-p278-52x9-cffx |
