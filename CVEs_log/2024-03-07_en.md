| 1 | CVE-2024-0825 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Vimeography: Vimeo Video Gallery WordPress Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.2 via deserialization of untrusted input via the vimeography_duplicate_gallery_serialized in the duplicate_gallery function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers attackers, with contributor access or higher, to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/vimeography/trunk/lib/api/galleries.php#L816<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/853516b2-ec50-4937-89d3-d16042a6f71c?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2024-1731 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Auto Refresh Single Page plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.1 via deserialization of untrusted input from the arsp_options post meta option. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin.
