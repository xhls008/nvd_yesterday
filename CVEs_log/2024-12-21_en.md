| 13 | CVE-2024-55470 | 7.5  | HIGH | Oqtane Framework 6.0.0 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control. By manipulating the entityid parameter, attackers can bypass passcode validation and successfully log into the application or access restricted data without proper authorization. The lack of server-side validation exacerbates the issue, as the application relies on client-side information for authentication. | [1]https://gist.github.com/Kaushikjoshi/2d8ad350ba5e72030fcee2536498cfe4<br>[2]https://github.com/oqtane/oqtane.framework/pull/4878/files |

| 16 | CVE-2024-56334 | 7.8  | HIGH | systeminformation is a System and OS information library for node.js. In affected versions SSIDs are not sanitized when before they are passed as a parameter to cmd.exe in the `getWindowsIEEE8021x` function. This means that malicious content in the SSID can be executed as OS commands. This vulnerability may enable an attacker, depending on how the package is used, to perform remote code execution or local privilege escalation. This issue has been addressed in version 5.23.7 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/commit/f7af0a67b78e7894335a6cad510566a25e06ae41<br>[2]https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/security/advisories/GHSA-cvv5-9h9w-qp2m |
| 17 | CVE-2024-56335 | 7.6  | HIGH | vaultwarden is an unofficial Bitwarden compatible server written in Rust, formerly known as bitwarden_rs. In affected versions an attacker is capable of updating or deleting groups from an organization given a few conditions: 1. The attacker has a user account in the server. 2. The attacker`s account has admin or owner permissions in an unrelated organization. 3. The attacker knows the target organization`s UUID and the target group`s UUID. Note that this vulnerability is related to group functionality and as such is only applicable for servers who have enabled the `ORG_GROUPS_ENABLED` setting, which is disabled by default. This attack can lead to different situations: 1. Denial of service, the attacker can limit users from accessing the organization`s data by removing their membership from the group. 2. Privilege escalation, if the attacker is part of the victim organization, they can escalate their own privileges by joining a group they wouldn`t normally have access to. For attackers that aren`t part of the organization, this shouldn`t lead to any possible plain-text data exfiltration as all the data is encrypted client side. This vulnerability is patched in Vaultwarden `1.32.7`, and users are recommended to update as soon as possible. If it`s not possible to update to `1.32.7`,  some possible workarounds are: 1. Disabling `ORG_GROUPS_ENABLED`, which would disable groups functionality on the server. 2. Disabling `SIGNUPS_ALLOWED`, which would not allow an attacker to create new accounts on the server. | [1]https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/security/advisories/GHSA-g65h-982x-4m5m |
| 18 | CVE-2024-56357 | 8.1  | HIGH | grist-core is a spreadsheet hosting server. A user visiting a malicious document or submitting a malicious form could have their account compromised, because it was possible to use the `javascript:` scheme with custom widget URLs and form redirect URLs. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid visiting documents or forms prepared by people they do not trust. | [1]https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/commit/10b069005ec8d5f511e6554a56111d8f257f029e<br>[2]https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/security/advisories/GHSA-cq5q-cqr7-vmf6 |
| 19 | CVE-2024-56358 | 8.1  | HIGH | grist-core is a spreadsheet hosting server. A user visiting a malicious document and previewing an attachment could have their account compromised, because JavaScript in an SVG file would be evaluated in the context of their current page. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid previewing attachments in documents prepared by people they do not trust. | [1]https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/commit/a792bdc43b456dbdd6fdc50d8747f4c349fab2f4<br>[2]https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/security/advisories/GHSA-jvfm-gf4f-33q3 |
| 20 | CVE-2024-56359 | 8.1  | HIGH | grist-core is a spreadsheet hosting server. A user visiting a malicious document and clicking on a link in a HyperLink cell using a control modifier (meaning for example Ctrl+click) could have their account compromised, since the link could use the javascript: scheme and be evaluated in the context of their current page. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid clicking on HyperLink cell links using a control modifier in documents prepared by people they do not trust. | [1]https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/commit/a792bdc43b456dbdd6fdc50d8747f4c349fab2f4<br>[2]https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/security/advisories/GHSA-qv69-5cj2-53r9 |
