| 3 | CVE-2025-30194 | 7.5  | HIGH | When DNSdist is configured to provide DoH via the nghttp2 provider, an attacker can cause a denial of service by crafting a DoH exchange that triggers an illegal memory access (double-free) and crash of DNSdist, causing a denial of service.The remedy is: upgrade to the patched 1.9.9 version.A workaround is to temporarily switch to the h2o provider until DNSdist has been upgraded to a fixed version.We would like to thank Charles Howes for bringing this issue to our attention. | [1]https://dnsdist.org/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-for-dnsdist-2025-02.html<br>[2]http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/04/29/1 |
