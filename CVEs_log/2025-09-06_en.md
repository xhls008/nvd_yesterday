| 1 | CVE-2025-58179 | 7.2  | HIGH | Astro is a web framework for content-driven websites. Versions 11.0.3 through 12.6.5 are vulnerable to SSRF when using Astro`s Cloudflare adapter. When configured with output: `server` while using the default imageService: `compile`, the generated image optimization endpoint doesn`t check the URLs it receives, allowing content from unauthorized third-party domains to be served. a A bug in impacted versions of the @astrojs/cloudflare adapter for deployment on Cloudflare’s infrastructure, allows an attacker to bypass the third-party domain restrictions and serve any content from the vulnerable origin. This issue is fixed in version 12.6.6. | [1]https://github.com/withastro/astro/commit/9ecf3598e2b29dd74614328fde3047ea90e67252<br>[2]https://github.com/withastro/astro/security/advisories/GHSA-qpr4-c339-7vq8 |
| 2 | CVE-2025-58362 | 7.5  | HIGH | Hono is a Web application framework that provides support for any JavaScript runtime. Versions 4.8.0 through 4.9.5 contain a flaw in the getPath utility function which could allow path confusion and potential bypass of proxy-level ACLs (e.g. Nginx location blocks). The original implementation relied on fixed character offsets when parsing request URLs. Under certain malformed absolute-form Request-URIs, this could lead to incorrect path extraction depending on the application and environment. If proxy ACLs are used to protect sensitive endpoints such as /admin, this flaw could have allowed unauthorized access. The confidentiality impact depends on what data is exposed: if sensitive administrative data is exposed, the impact may be high, otherwise it may be moderate. This issue is fixed in version 4.9.6. | [1]https://github.com/honojs/hono/commit/1d79aedc3f82d8c9969b115fe61bc4bd705ec8de<br>[2]https://github.com/honojs/hono/releases/tag/v4.9.6<br>[3]https://github.com/honojs/hono/security/advisories/GHSA-9hp6-4448-45g2 |
