| 21 | CVE-2025-66449 | 8.8  | HIGH | ConvertXis a self-hosted online file converter. In versions prior to 0.16.0, the endpoint `/upload` allows an authenticated user to write arbitrary files on the system, overwriting binaries and allowing code execution. The upload function takes `file.name` directly from user supplied data without doing any sanitization on the name thus allowing for arbitrary file write. This can be used to overwrite system binaries with ones provided from an attacker allowing full code execution. Version 0.16.0 contains a patch for the issue. | [1]https://github.com/C4illin/ConvertX/blob/4ae2aab66ace7cdcc14c5a16ecaaf2372b9ccbdf/src/pages/upload.tsx#L27-L30<br>[2]https://github.com/C4illin/ConvertX/commit/550f472451755d095cf5802bc91f403e85b7129e<br>[3]https://github.com/C4illin/ConvertX/security/advisories/GHSA-cpww-gwgc-p72r<br>[4]https://github.com/C4illin/ConvertX/security/advisories/GHSA-cpww-gwgc-p72r |
| 22 | CVE-2025-67744 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | DeepChat is an open-source artificial intelligence agent platform that unifies models, tools, and agents. Prior to version 0.5.3, a security vulnerability exists in the Mermaid diagram rendering component that allows arbitrary JavaScript execution. Due to the exposure of the Electron IPC renderer to the DOM, this Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw escalates to full Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands. Two concurrent issues, unsafe Mermaid configuration and an exposed IPC interface, cause this issue. Version 0.5.3 contains a patch. | [1]https://github.com/ThinkInAIXYZ/deepchat/commit/b179d97921af04a0ae1ae68757338dd8b8cbefe7<br>[2]https://github.com/ThinkInAIXYZ/deepchat/security/advisories/GHSA-w8w8-82pv-5rg9 |

Versions prior to 2.7.1 are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to unsafe handling of browser-renderable user uploads when served through the sharing and download endpoints. An attacker who can get a crafted SVG (primary) or HTML (secondary) file stored in a FileRise instance can cause JavaScript execution when a victim opens a generated share link (and in some cases via the direct download endpoint). This impacts share links (`/api/file/share.php`) and direct file access / download path (`/api/file/download.php`), depending on browser/content-type behavior.

| 54 | CVE-2025-46295 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Apache Commons Text versions prior to 1.10.0 included interpolation features that could be abused when applications passed untrusted input into the text-substitution API. Because some interpolators could trigger actions like executing commands or accessing external resources, an attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution. This vulnerability has been fully addressed in FileMaker Server 22.0.4. | [1]https://support.claris.com/s/answerview?anum=000049059&language=en_US |
| 55 | CVE-2025-68154 | 8.1  | HIGH | systeminformation is a System and OS information library for node.js. In versions prior to 5.27.14, the `fsSize()` function in systeminformation is vulnerable to OS command injection on Windows systems. The optional `drive` parameter is directly concatenated into a PowerShell command without sanitization, allowing arbitrary command execution when user-controlled input reaches this function. The actual exploitability depends on how applications use this function. If an application does not pass user-controlled input to `fsSize()`, it is not vulnerable. Version 5.27.14 contains a patch. | [1]https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/commit/c52f9fd07fef42d2d8e8c66f75b42178da701c68<br>[2]https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/security/advisories/GHSA-wphj-fx3q-84ch |
| 56 | CVE-2025-68155 | 7.5  | HIGH | @vitejs/plugin-rs provides React Server Components (RSC) support for Vite. Prior to version 0.5.8, the `/__vite_rsc_findSourceMapURL` endpoint in `@vitejs/plugin-rsc` allows unauthenticated arbitrary file read during development mode. An attacker can read any file accessible to the Node.js process by sending a crafted HTTP request with a `file://` URL in the `filename` query parameter.

| 57 | CVE-2025-68156 | 7.5  | HIGH | Expr is an expression language and expression evaluation for Go. Prior to version 1.17.7, several builtin functions in Expr, including `flatten`, `min`, `max`, `mean`, and `median`, perform recursive traversal over user-provided data structures without enforcing a maximum recursion depth. If the evaluation environment contains deeply nested or cyclic data structures, these functions may recurse indefinitely until exceed the Go runtime stack limit. This results in a stack overflow panic, causing the host application to crash. While exploitability depends on whether an attacker can influence or inject cyclic or pathologically deep data into theevaluation environment, this behavior represents a denial-of-service (DoS) risk and affects overall library robustness. Instead of returning a recoverable evaluation error, the process may terminate unexpectedly. In affected versions, evaluation of expressions that invoke certain builtin functions on untrusted or insufficiently validated data structures can lead to a process-level crash due to stack exhaustion. This issue is most relevant in scenarios where Expr is used to evaluate expressions against externally supplied or dynamically constructed environments; cyclic references (directly or indirectly) can be introduced into arrays, maps, or structs; and there are no application-level safeguards preventing deeply nested input data. In typical use cases with controlled, acyclic data, the issue may not manifest. However, when present, the resulting panic can be used to reliably crash the application, constituting a denial of service. The issue has been fixed in the v1.17.7 versions of Expr. The patch introduces a maximum recursion depth limit for affected builtin functions. When this limit is exceeded, evaluation aborts gracefully and returns a descriptive error instead of panicking. Additionally, the maximum depth can be customized by users via `builtin.MaxDepth`, allowing applications with legitimate deep structures to raise the limit in a controlled manner. Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the patched release, which includes both the recursion guard and comprehensive test coverage to prevent regressions. For users who cannot immediately upgrade, some mitigations are recommended. Ensure that evaluation environments cannot contain cyclic references, validate or sanitize externally supplied data structures before passing them to Expr, and/or wrap expression evaluation with panic recovery to prevent a full process crash (as a last-resort defensive measure). These workarounds reduce risk but do not fully eliminate the issue without the patch. | [1]https://github.com/expr-lang/expr/pull/870<br>[2]https://github.com/expr-lang/expr/security/advisories/GHSA-cfpf-hrx2-8rv6 |
