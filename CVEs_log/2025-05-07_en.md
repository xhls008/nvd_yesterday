| 4 | CVE-2025-2509 | 7.8  | HIGH | Out-of-Bounds Read in Virglrenderer in ChromeOS  16093.57.0 allows a malicious guest VM to achieve arbitrary address access within the crosvm sandboxed process, potentially leading to VM escape via crafted vertex elements data triggering an out-of-bounds read in util_format_description. | [1]https://issues.chromium.org/issues/b/385851796<br>[2]https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/385851796 |
| 5 | CVE-2025-46728 | 7.5  | HIGH | cpp-httplib is a C++ header-only HTTP/HTTPS server and client library. Prior to version 0.20.1, the library fails to enforce configured size limits on incoming request bodies when `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` is used or when no `Content-Length` header is provided. A remote attacker can send a chunked request without the terminating zero-length chunk, causing uncontrolled memory allocation on the server. This leads to potential exhaustion of system memory and results in a server crash or unresponsiveness. Version 0.20.1 fixes the issue by enforcing limits during parsing. If the limit is exceeded at any point during reading, the connection is terminated immediately. A short-term workaround through a Reverse Proxy is available. If updating the library immediately is not feasible, deploy a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) in front of the `cpp-httplib` application. Configure the proxy to enforce maximum request body size limits, thereby stopping excessively large requests before they reach the vulnerable library code. | [1]https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib/commit/7b752106ac42bd5b907793950d9125a0972c8e8e<br>[2]https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib/security/advisories/GHSA-px83-72rx-v57c |

| 74 | CVE-2025-30165 | 8.0  | HIGH | vLLM is an inference and serving engine for large language models. In a multi-node vLLM deployment using the V0 engine, vLLM uses ZeroMQ for some multi-node communication purposes. The secondary vLLM hosts open a `SUB` ZeroMQ socket and connect to an `XPUB` socket on the primary vLLM host. When data is received on this `SUB` socket, it is deserialized with `pickle`. This is unsafe, as it can be abused to execute code on a remote machine. Since the vulnerability exists in a client that connects to the primary vLLM host, this vulnerability serves as an escalation point. If the primary vLLM host is compromised, this vulnerability could be used to compromise the rest of the hosts in the vLLM deployment. Attackers could also use other means to exploit the vulnerability without requiring access to the primary vLLM host. One example would be the use of ARP cache poisoning to redirect traffic to a malicious endpoint used to deliver a payload with arbitrary code to execute on the target machine. Note that this issue only affects the V0 engine, which has been off by default since v0.8.0. Further, the issue only applies to a deployment using tensor parallelism across multiple hosts, which we do not expect to be a common deployment pattern. Since V0 is has been off by default since v0.8.0 and the fix is fairly invasive, the maintainers of vLLM have decided not to fix this issue. Instead, the maintainers recommend that users ensure their environment is on a secure network in case this pattern is in use. The V1 engine is not affected by this issue. | [1]https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/c21b99b91241409c2fdf9f3f8c542e8748b317be/vllm/distributed/device_communicators/shm_broadcast.py#L295-L301<br>[2]https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/c21b99b91241409c2fdf9f3f8c542e8748b317be/vllm/distributed/device_communicators/shm_broadcast.py#L468-L470<br>[3]https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/GHSA-9pcc-gvx5-r5wm |

| 76 | CVE-2025-46815 | 8.0  | HIGH | The identity infrastructure software ZITADEL offers developers the ability to manage user sessions using the Session API. This API enables the use of IdPs for authentication, known as idp intents. Following a successful idp intent, the client receives an id and token on a predefined URI. These id and token can then be used to authenticate the user or their session. However, prior to versions 3.0.0, 2.71.9, and 2.70.10, it was possible to exploit this feature by repeatedly using intents. This allowed an attacker with access to the application’s URI to retrieve the id and token, enabling them to authenticate on behalf of the user. It`s important to note that the use of additional factors (MFA) prevents a complete authentication process and, consequently, access to the ZITADEL API. Versions 3.0.0, 2.71.9, and 2.70.10 contain a fix for the issue. No known workarounds other than upgrading are available. | [1]https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/commit/b1e60e7398d677f08b06fd7715227f70b7ca1162<br>[2]https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.70.10<br>[3]https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.71.9<br>[4]https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v3.0.0<br>[5]https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/security/advisories/GHSA-g4r8-mp7g-85fq |
| 77 | CVE-2025-46820 | 7.1  | HIGH | phpgt/Dom provides access to modern DOM APIs. Versions of phpgt/Dom prior to 4.1.8 expose the GITHUB_TOKEN in the Dom workflow run artifact. The ci.yml workflow file uses actions/upload-artifact@v4 to upload the build artifact. This artifact is a zip of the current directory, which includes the automatically generated .git/config file containing the run`s GITHUB_TOKEN. Seeing as the artifact can be downloaded prior to the end of the workflow, there is a few seconds where an attacker can extract the token from the artifact and use it with the GitHub API to push malicious code or rewrite release commits in your repository. Any downstream user of the repository may be affected, but the token should only be valid for the duration of the workflow run, limiting the time during which exploitation could occur. Version 4.1.8 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/phpgt/Dom/commit/205cddcc82c002dfa48e874494efbf4c49497394<br>[2]https://github.com/phpgt/Dom/security/advisories/GHSA-cwj7-6v67-2cm4 |
| 78 | CVE-2024-12225 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | A vulnerability was found in Quarkus in the quarkus-security-webauthn module. The Quarkus WebAuthn module publishes default REST endpoints for registering and logging users in while allowing developers to provide custom REST endpoints. When developers provide custom REST endpoints, the default endpoints remain accessible, potentially allowing attackers to obtain a login cookie that has no corresponding user in the Quarkus application or, depending on how the application is written, could correspond to an existing user that has no relation with the current attacker, allowing anyone to log in as an existing user by just knowing that user`s user name. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-12225<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2330484 |
