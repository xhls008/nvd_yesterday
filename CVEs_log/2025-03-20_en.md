| 5 | CVE-2024-12295 | 8.8  | HIGH | The BoomBox Theme Extensions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user`s identity prior to updating their password through the `boombox_ajax_reset_password` function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level privileges and above, to change arbitrary user`s passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/boombox-viral-buzz-wordpress-theme/16596434<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c453aaf6-767d-4929-bbb3-3c0b78b0507a?source=cve |

| 7 | CVE-2024-12922 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Altair theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check within functions.php in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/tour-travel-agency-altair-theme/9318575<br>[2]https://themeforest.net/item/tour-travel-agency-altair-theme/9318575#item-description__changelog<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e27971a3-f84c-4f13-81af-127e7560566a?source=cve |

| 10 | CVE-2025-1232 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Site Reviews WordPress plugin before 7.2.5 does not properly sanitise and escape some of its Review fields, which could allow unauthenticated users to perform Stored XSS attacks | [1]https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/c4ea8357-ddd7-48ac-80c9-15b924715b14/ |
| 11 | CVE-2025-30236 | 8.6  | HIGH | Shearwater SecurEnvoy SecurAccess Enrol before 9.4.515 allows authentication through only a six-digit TOTP code (skipping a password check) if an HTTP POST request contains a SESSION parameter. | [1]https://reserge.org/probabilistically-breaking-securenvoy-totp/<br>[2]https://securenvoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Release-Notes-9.4.515.pdf |
| 12 | CVE-2024-13410 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The CozyStay and TinySalt plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.0, and in all versions up to, and including 3.9.0, respectively, via deserialization of untrusted input in the `ajax_handler` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/cozystay-hotel-booking-wordpress-theme/47383367#item-description__changelog<br>[2]https://themeforest.net/item/tinysalt-personal-food-blog-wordpress-theme/26294668#item-description__changelog<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/61080df6-836f-4365-964a-fa2517e8be5a?source=cve |

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included. | [1]https://changelog.thememove.com/minimog-wp/<br>[2]https://themeforest.net/item/minimog-the-high-converting-ecommerce-wordpress-theme/36947163<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b3ae0e08-5cdc-47ff-b094-3920d56a50f7?source=cve |

| 26 | CVE-2025-27415 | 7.5  | HIGH | Nuxt is an open-source web development framework for Vue.js. Prior to 3.16.0, by sending a crafted HTTP request to a server behind an CDN, it is possible in some circumstances to poison the CDN cache and highly impacts the availability of a site. It is possible to craft a request, such as https://mysite.com/?/_payload.json which will be rendered as JSON. If the CDN in front of a Nuxt site ignores the query string when determining whether to cache a route, then this JSON response could be served to future visitors to the site. An attacker can perform this attack to a vulnerable site in order to make a site unavailable indefinitely. It is also possible in the case where the cache will be reset to make a small script to send a request each X seconds (=caching duration) so that the cache is permanently poisoned making the site completely unavailable. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.16.0. | [1]https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/security/advisories/GHSA-jvhm-gjrh-3h93 |
