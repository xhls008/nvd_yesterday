| 1 | CVE-2026-0617 | 7.2  | HIGH | The LatePoint – Calendar Booking Plugin for Appointments and Events plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the customer profile fields in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever an administrator views the customer`s activity history. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/latepoint/tags/5.2.5/lib/controllers/activities_controller.php<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/latepoint/tags/5.2.5/lib/models/activity_model.php<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/latepoint/tags/5.2.5/lib/views/activities/view.php#L27<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3449263%40latepoint%2Ftrunk&old=3408660%40latepoint%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/22bcfd36-ecf9-4d2c-ac94-94ffa0340c4c?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2026-1058 | 7.1  | HIGH | The Form Maker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via hidden field values in all versions up to, and including, 1.15.35. This is due to insufficient output escaping when displaying hidden field values in the admin submissions list. The plugin uses html_entity_decode() on user-supplied hidden field values without subsequent escaping before output, which converts HTML entity-encoded payloads back into executable JavaScript. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in the admin submissions view that will execute whenever an administrator accesses the submissions list. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/form-maker/tags/1.15.34/admin/views/Submissions_fm.php#L759<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3447011%40form-maker%2Ftrunk&old=3440395%40form-maker%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e0ec0027-2792-4069-b413-8fdd951f5fe7?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2026-1065 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Form Maker by 10Web plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 1.15.35. This is due to the plugin`s default file upload allowlist including SVG files combined with weak substring-based extension validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload malicious SVG files containing JavaScript code that will execute when viewed by administrators or site visitors via file upload fields in forms granted they can submit forms. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/form-maker/tags/1.15.34/frontend/models/form_maker.php#L1744<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/form-maker/tags/1.15.34/frontend/models/form_maker.php#L1855<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/form-maker/tags/1.15.34/js/add_field.js#L2364<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3447011%40form-maker%2Ftrunk&old=3440395%40form-maker%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/8230d5f8-01d9-465a-8a43-e9852248bb3d?source=cve |

This is due to missing object-level authorization checks in the `course_list_bulk_action()`, `bulk_delete_course()`, and `update_course_status()` functions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Tutor Instructor-level access and above, to modify or delete arbitrary courses they do not own by manipulating course IDs in bulk action requests. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tutor/tags/3.9.5/classes/Course_List.php#L289<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tutor/tags/3.9.5/classes/Course_List.php#L437<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tutor/tags/3.9.5/classes/Course_List.php#L463<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3448615/tutor/trunk/classes/Course_List.php?contextall=1&old=3339576&old_path=%2Ftutor%2Ftrunk%2Fclasses%2FCourse_List.php<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/4e95b32b-c050-41eb-8fce-461257420eb6?source=cve |
