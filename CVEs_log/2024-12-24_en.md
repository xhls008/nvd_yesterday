| 1 | CVE-2024-12899 | 7.3  | HIGH | A vulnerability was found in 1000 Projects Attendance Tracking Management System 1.0. It has been rated as critical. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /admin/course_action.php. The manipulation of the argument course_code leads to sql injection. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. | [1]https://1000projects.org/<br>[2]https://github.com/Murrayzed/CVE/issues/1<br>[3]https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.289169<br>[4]https://vuldb.com/?id.289169<br>[5]https://vuldb.com/?submit.467628 |
| 2 | CVE-2024-12902 | 8.4  | HIGH | ANCHOR from Global Wisdom Software is an integrated product running on a Windows virtual machine. The underlying Windows OS of the product contains high-privilege service accounts. If these accounts use default passwords, attackers could remotely log in to the virtual machine using the default credentials. | [1]https://www.twcert.org.tw/en/cp-139-8315-e6069-2.html<br>[2]https://www.twcert.org.tw/tw/cp-132-8314-983c9-1.html |
| 3 | CVE-2024-12903 | 7.8  | HIGH | Incorrect default permissions vulnerability in Evoko Home, affecting version 2.4.2 to 2.7.4. A non-admin user could exploit weak file and folder permissions to escalate privileges, execute arbitrary code and maintain persistence on the compromised machine. It has been identified that full control permissions exist on the ‘Everyone’ group (i.e. any user who has local access to the operating system regardless of their privileges). | [1]https://www.incibe.es/en/incibe-cert/notices/aviso/incorrect-default-permissions-biamp-evoko-home |
| 4 | CVE-2024-45387 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | An SQL injection vulnerability in Traffic Ops in Apache Traffic Control <= 8.0.1, >= 8.0.0 allows a privileged user with role "admin", "federation", "operations", "portal", or "steering" to execute arbitrary SQL against the database by sending a specially-crafted PUT request.Users are recommended to upgrade to version Apache Traffic Control 8.0.2 if you run an affected version of Traffic Ops. | [1]https://lists.apache.org/thread/t38nk5n7t8w3pb66z7z4pqfzt4443trr<br>[2]http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/12/23/3 |
| 5 | CVE-2024-53256 | 7.8  | HIGH | Rizin is a UNIX-like reverse engineering framework and command-line toolset. `rizin.c` still had an old snippet of code which suffered a command injection due the usage of `rz_core_cmdf` to invoke the command `m` which was removed in v0.1.x. A malicious binary defining `bclass` (part of RzBinInfo) is executed if `rclass` (part of RzBinInfo) is set to `fs`; the vulnerability can be exploited by any bin format where `bclass` and `rclass` are user defined. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.7.4. | [1]https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/blob/be24ca8879ed9c58f288bdf21c271b6294720da4/librz/main/rizin.c#L1275-L1278<br>[2]https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/commit/db6c5b39c065ce719f587c9815c47fbb834b10fa<br>[3]https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/security/advisories/GHSA-5jhc-frm4-p8v9 |
| 6 | CVE-2024-56362 | 7.1  | HIGH | Navidrome is an open source web-based music collection server and streamer. Navidrome stores the JWT secret in plaintext in the navidrome.db database file under the property table. This practice introduces a security risk because anyone with access to the database file can retrieve the secret. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.54.1. | [1]https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome/commit/7f030b0859653593fd2ac0df69f4a313f9caf9ff<br>[2]https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome/commit/9cbdb20a318a49daf95888b1fd207d4d729b55f1<br>[3]https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome/security/advisories/GHSA-xwx7-p63r-2rj8 |
| 7 | CVE-2024-56363 | 7.8  | HIGH | APTRS (Automated Penetration Testing Reporting System) is a Python and Django-based automated reporting tool designed for penetration testers and security organizations. In 1.0, there is a vulnerability in the web application`s handling of user-supplied input that is incorporated into a Jinja2 template. Specifically, when user input is improperly sanitized or validated, an attacker can inject Jinja2 syntax into the template, causing the server to execute arbitrary code. For example, an attacker might be able to inject expressions like {{ config }}, {{ self.class.mro[1].subclasses() }}, or more dangerous payloads that trigger execution of arbitrary Python code. The vulnerability can be reproduced by submitting crafted input to all the template fields handled by ckeditor, that are passed directly to a Jinja2 template. If the input is rendered without sufficient sanitization, it results in the execution of malicious Jinja2 code on the server. | [1]https://github.com/APTRS/APTRS/commit/9f6b6e4a56a9119eb12126a4909441e83b6d7c11<br>[2]https://github.com/APTRS/APTRS/security/advisories/GHSA-h4w2-hvcg-938j |
| 8 | CVE-2024-53961 | 7.4  | HIGH | ColdFusion versions 2023.11, 2021.17 and earlier are affected by an Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (`Path Traversal`) vulnerability that could lead to arbitrary file system read. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory set by the application. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information or the manipulation of system data. | [1]https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/coldfusion/apsb24-107.html |
