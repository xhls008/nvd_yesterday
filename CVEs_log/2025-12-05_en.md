| 10 | CVE-2025-65945 | 7.5  | HIGH | auth0/node-jws is a JSON Web Signature implementation for Node.js. In versions 3.2.2 and earlier and version 4.0.0, auth0/node-jws has an improper signature verification vulnerability when using the HS256 algorithm under specific conditions. Applications are affected when they use the jws.createVerify() function for HMAC algorithms and use user-provided data from the JSON Web Signature protected header or payload in HMAC secret lookup routines, which can allow attackers to bypass signature verification. This issue has been patched in versions 3.2.3 and 4.0.1. | [1]https://github.com/auth0/node-jws/commit/34c45b2c04434f925b638de6a061de9339c0ea2e<br>[2]https://github.com/auth0/node-jws/security/advisories/GHSA-869p-cjfg-cm3x |
| 11 | CVE-2025-12097 | 7.5  | HIGH | There is a relative path traversal vulnerability in the NI System Web Server that may result in information disclosure.  Successful exploitation requires an attacker to send a specially crafted request to the NI System Web Server, allowing the attacker to read arbitrary files.  This vulnerability existed in the NI System Web Server 2012 and prior versions.  It was fixed in 2013. | [1]https://www.ni.com/en/support/security/available-critical-and-security-updates-for-ni-software/relative-path-traversal-vulnerability-in-ni-system-web-server.html |
| 12 | CVE-2025-12995 | 8.1  | HIGH | Medtronic CareLink Network allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to perform a brute force attack on an API endpoint that could be used to determine a valid password under certain circumstances. This issue affects CareLink Network: before December 4, 2025. | [1]https://www.medtronic.com/en-us/e/product-security/security-bulletins/carelink-network-vulnerabilities.html |
| 13 | CVE-2025-65958 | 8.5  | HIGH | Open WebUI is a self-hosted artificial intelligence platform designed to operate entirely offline. Prior to 0.6.37, a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Open WebUI allows any authenticated user to force the server to make HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs. This can be exploited to access cloud metadata endpoints (AWS/GCP/Azure), scan internal networks, access internal services behind firewalls, and exfiltrate sensitive information. No special permissions beyond basic authentication are required. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.37. | [1]https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/commit/02238d3113e966c353fce18f1b65117380896774<br>[2]https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/security/advisories/GHSA-c6xv-rcvw-v685 |
| 14 | CVE-2025-13543 | 8.8  | HIGH | The PostGallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to incorrect file type validation in the `PostGalleryUploader` class functions in all versions up to, and including, 1.12.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level and above permissions, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/postgallery/tags/1.12.5/admin/PostGalleryUploader.php<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/13348eb5-5001-4ec4-bc6a-44795bbed203?source=cve |
| 15 | CVE-2025-65959 | 8.7  | HIGH | Open WebUI is a self-hosted artificial intelligence platform designed to operate entirely offline. Prior to 0.6.37, a Stored XSS vulnerability was discovered in Open-WebUI`s Notes PDF download functionality. An attacker can import a Markdown file containing malicious SVG tags into Notes, allowing them to execute arbitrary JavaScript code and steal session tokens when a victim downloads the note as PDF. This vulnerability can be exploited by any authenticated user, and unauthenticated external attackers can steal session tokens from users (both admin and regular users) by sharing specially crafted markdown files. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.37. | [1]https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/commit/03cc6ce8eb5c055115406e2304fbf7e3338b8dce<br>[2]https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/security/advisories/GHSA-8wvc-869r-xfqf |
| 16 | CVE-2025-53704 | 7.5  | HIGH | The password reset mechanism for the Pivot client application is weak, and it may allow an attacker to take over the account. | [1]https://github.com/cisagov/CSAF/blob/develop/csaf_files/OT/white/2025/icsa-25-338-02.json<br>[2]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-25-338-02<br>[3]https://www.maxhub.com/en/support/ |
| 17 | CVE-2025-66238 | 7.2  | HIGH | DCIM dcTrack allows an attacker to misuse certain remote access features. An authenticated user with access to the appliance`s virtual console could exploit these features to redirect network traffic, potentially accessing restricted services or data on the host machine. | [1]https://github.com/cisagov/CSAF/blob/develop/csaf_files/OT/white/2025/icsa-25-338-05.json<br>[2]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-25-338-05 |
| 18 | CVE-2025-66506 | 7.5  | HIGH | Fulcio is a free-to-use certificate authority for issuing code signing certificates for an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity. Prior to 1.8.3, function identity.extractIssuerURL splits (via a call to strings.Split) its argument (which is untrusted data) on periods. As a result, in the face of a malicious request with an (invalid) OIDC identity token in the payload containing many period characters, a call to extractIssuerURL incurs allocations to the tune of O(n) bytes (where n stands for the length of the function`s argument), with a constant factor of about 16. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.8.3. | [1]https://github.com/sigstore/fulcio/commit/765a0e57608b9ef390e1eeeea8595b9054c63a5a<br>[2]https://github.com/sigstore/fulcio/security/advisories/GHSA-f83f-xpx7-ffpw |
| 19 | CVE-2025-13373 | 7.5  | HIGH | Advantech iView versions 5.7.05.7057 and prior do not properly sanitize SNMP v1 trap (Port 162) requests, which could allow an attacker to inject SQL commands. | [1]https://github.com/cisagov/CSAF/blob/develop/csaf_files/OT/white/2025/icsa-25-338-07.json<br>[2]https://www.advantech.com/zh-tw/support/details/firmware?id=1-HIPU-183<br>[3]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-25-338-07 |
| 20 | CVE-2025-66561 | 7.3  | HIGH | SysReptor is a fully customizable pentest reporting platform. Prior to 2025.102, there is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows authenticated users to execute malicious JavaScript in the context of other logged-in users by uploading malicious JavaScript files in the web UI. This vulnerability is fixed in 2025.102. | [1]https://github.com/Syslifters/sysreptor/security/advisories/GHSA-64vw-v5c4-mgvm |
| 21 | CVE-2025-66564 | 7.5  | HIGH | Sigstore Timestamp Authority is a service for issuing RFC 3161 timestamps. Prior to 2.0.3, Function api.ParseJSONRequest currently splits (via a call to strings.Split) an optionally-provided OID (which is untrusted data) on periods. Similarly, function api.getContentType splits the Content-Type header (which is also untrusted data) on an application string. As a result, in the face of a malicious request with either an excessively long OID in the payload containing many period characters or a malformed Content-Type header, a call to api.ParseJSONRequest or api.getContentType incurs allocations of O(n) bytes (where n stands for the length of the function`s argument). This vulnerability is fixed in 2.0.3. | [1]https://github.com/sigstore/timestamp-authority/commit/0cae34e197d685a14904e0bad135b89d13b69421<br>[2]https://github.com/sigstore/timestamp-authority/security/advisories/GHSA-4qg8-fj49-pxjh |
