| 1 | CVE-2026-21897 | 7.3  | HIGH | CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. Prior to version 1.4.3, the Crypto_Config_Add_Gvcid_Managed_Parameters function only checks whether gvcid_counter > GVCID_MAN_PARAM_SIZE. As a result, it allows up to the 251st entry, which causes a write past the end of the array, overwriting gvcid_counter located immediately after gvcid_managed_parameters_array[250]. This leads to an out-of-bounds write, and the overwritten gvcid_counter may become an arbitrary value, potentially affecting the parameter lookup/registration logic that relies on it. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.3. | [1]https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/releases/tag/v1.4.3<br>[2]https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-9x7j-gx23-7m5r |
| 2 | CVE-2026-21898 | 8.2  | HIGH | CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. Prior to version 1.4.3, the Crypto_AOS_ProcessSecurity function reads memory without valid bounds checking when parsing AOS frame hashes. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.3. | [1]https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/releases/tag/v1.4.3<br>[2]https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-7ch6-2pmg-m853 |
| 3 | CVE-2026-22697 | 7.5  | HIGH | CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. Prior to version 1.4.3, CryptoLib’s KMC crypto service integration is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow when decoding Base64-encoded ciphertext/cleartext fields returned by the KMC service. The decode destination buffer is sized using an expected output length (len_data_out), but the Base64 decoder writes output based on the actual Base64 input length and does not enforce any destination size limit. An oversized Base64 string in the KMC JSON response can cause out-of-bounds writes on the heap, resulting in process crash and potentially code execution under certain conditions. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.3. | [1]https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/releases/tag/v1.4.3<br>[2]https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-qjx3-83jh-2jc4 |
| 4 | CVE-2026-22600 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | OpenProject is an open-source, web-based project management software. A Local File Read (LFR) vulnerability exists in the work package PDF export functionality of OpenProject prior to version 16.6.4. By uploading a specially crafted SVG file (disguised as a PNG) as a work package attachment, an attacker can exploit the backend image processing engine (ImageMagick). When the work package is exported to PDF, the backend attempts to resize the image, triggering the ImageMagick text: coder. This allows an attacker to read arbitrary local files that the application user has permissions to access (e.g., /etc/passwd, all project configuration files, private project data, etc.). The attack requires permissions to upload attachments to a container that can be exported to PDF, such as a work package. The issue has been patched in version 16.6.4. Those who are unable to upgrade may apply the patch manually. | [1]https://github.com/opf/openproject/releases/tag/v16.6.4<br>[2]https://github.com/opf/openproject/security/advisories/GHSA-m8f2-cwpq-vvhh |
| 5 | CVE-2025-59057 | 7.6  | HIGH | React Router is a router for React. In @remix-run/react versions 1.15.0 through 2.17.0. and react-router versions 7.0.0 through 7.8.2, a XSS vulnerability exists in in React Router`s meta()/<Meta> APIs in Framework Mode when generating script:ld+json tags which could allow arbitrary JavaScript execution during SSR if untrusted content is used to generate the tag. There is no impact if the application is being used in Declarative Mode (<BrowserRouter>) or Data Mode (createBrowserRouter/<RouterProvider>). This issue has been patched in @remix-run/react version 2.17.1 and react-router version 7.9.0. | [1]https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/security/advisories/GHSA-3cgp-3xvw-98x8 |
| 6 | CVE-2025-61686 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | React Router is a router for React. In @react-router/node versions 7.0.0 through 7.9.3, @remix-run/deno prior to version 2.17.2, and @remix-run/node prior to version 2.17.2, if createFileSessionStorage() is being used from @react-router/node (or @remix-run/node/@remix-run/deno in Remix v2) with an unsigned cookie, it is possible for an attacker to cause the session to try to read/write from a location outside the specified session file directory. The success of the attack would depend on the permissions of the web server process to access those files. Read files cannot be returned directly to the attacker. Session file reads would only succeed if the file matched the expected session file format. If the file matched the session file format, the data would be populated into the server side session but not directly returned to the attacker unless the application logic returned specific session information. This issue has been patched in @react-router/node version 7.9.4, @remix-run/deno version 2.17.2, and @remix-run/node version 2.17.2. | [1]https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/security/advisories/GHSA-9583-h5hc-x8cw |
| 7 | CVE-2026-21884 | 8.2  | HIGH | React Router is a router for React. In @remix-run/react version prior to 2.17.3. and react-router 7.0.0 through 7.11.0, a XSS vulnerability exists in in React Router`s <ScrollRestoration> API in Framework Mode when using the getKey/storageKey props during Server-Side Rendering which could allow arbitrary JavaScript execution during SSR if untrusted content is used to generate the keys. There is no impact if server-side rendering in Framework Mode is disabled, or if Declarative Mode (<BrowserRouter>) or Data Mode (createBrowserRouter/<RouterProvider>) is being used. This issue has been patched in @remix-run/react version 2.17.3 and react-router version 7.12.0. | [1]https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/security/advisories/GHSA-8v8x-cx79-35w7 |
| 8 | CVE-2026-22029 | 8.0  | HIGH | React Router is a router for React. In @remix-run/router version prior to 1.23.2. and react-router 7.0.0 through 7.11.0, React Router (and Remix v1/v2) SPA open navigation redirects originating from loaders or actions in Framework Mode, Data Mode, or the unstable RSC modes can result in unsafe URLs causing unintended javascript execution on the client. This is only an issue if you are creating redirect paths from untrusted content or via an open redirect. There is no impact if Declarative Mode (<BrowserRouter>) is being used. This issue has been patched in @remix-run/router version 1.23.2 and react-router version 7.12.0. | [1]https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/security/advisories/GHSA-2w69-qvjg-hvjx |

| 16 | CVE-2026-22685 | 8.8  | HIGH | DevToys is a desktop app for developers. In versions from 2.0.0.0 to before 2.0.9.0, a path traversal vulnerability exists in the DevToys extension installation mechanism. When processing extension packages (NUPKG archives), DevToys does not sufficiently validate file paths contained within the archive. A malicious extension package could include crafted file entries such as ../../…/target-file, causing the extraction process to write files outside the intended extensions directory. This flaw enables an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the user’s system with the privileges of the DevToys process. Depending on the environment, this may lead to code execution, configuration tampering, or corruption of application or system files. This issue has been patched in version 2.0.9.0. | [1]https://github.com/DevToys-app/DevToys/commit/02fb7d46d9c663a4ee6ed968baa6a8810405047f<br>[2]https://github.com/DevToys-app/DevToys/pull/1643<br>[3]https://github.com/DevToys-app/DevToys/security/advisories/GHSA-ggxr-h6fm-p2qh |
| 17 | CVE-2026-22699 | 7.5  | HIGH | RustCrypto: Elliptic Curves is general purpose Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) support, including types and traits for representing various elliptic curve forms, scalars, points, and public/secret keys composed thereof. In versions 0.14.0-pre.0 and 0.14.0-rc.0, a denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the SM2 PKE decryption path where an invalid elliptic-curve point (C1) is decoded and the resulting value is unwrapped without checking. Specifically, AffinePoint::from_encoded_point(&encoded_c1) may return a None/CtOption::None when the supplied coordinates are syntactically valid but do not lie on the SM2 curve. The calling code previously used .unwrap(), causing a panic when presented with such input. This issue has been patched via commit 085b7be. | [1]https://github.com/RustCrypto/elliptic-curves/commit/085b7bee647029bd189e1375203418205006bcab<br>[2]https://github.com/RustCrypto/elliptic-curves/pull/1602<br>[3]https://github.com/RustCrypto/elliptic-curves/security/advisories/GHSA-78p6-6878-8mj6 |
