This is due to insufficient sanitization of the $_SERVER[`HTTP_REFERERER`] parameter passed from the `nppp_handle_fastcgi_cache_actions_admin_bar` function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to execute code on the server. | [1]https://github.com/psaux-it/nginx-fastcgi-cache-purge-and-preload<br>[2]https://wordpress.org/plugins/fastcgi-cache-purge-and-preload-nginx/<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/bbe8c101-5e0a-4ba7-8ff7-4c8ed01e9ef5?source=cve |
| 10 | CVE-2025-7692 | 8.1  | HIGH | The Orion Login with SMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.5. This is due to the olws_handle_verify_phone() function not utilizing a strong enough OTP value, exposing the hash needed to generate the OTP value, and no restrictions on the number of attempts to submit the code. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as other users, including administrators, if they have access to their phone number. | [1]https://wordpress.org/plugins/orion-login-with-sms/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/31a47cbd-c19b-4ac3-87ed-2d4c5c0e9cb7?source=cve |

| 34 | CVE-2025-54072 | 7.5  | HIGH | yt-dlp is a feature-rich command-line audio/video downloader. In versions 2025.06.25 and below, when the --exec option is used on Windows with the default placeholder (or {}), insufficient sanitization is applied to the expanded filepath, allowing for remote code execution. This is a bypass of the mitigation for CVE-2024-22423 where the default placeholder and {} were not covered by the new escaping rules. Windows users who are unable to upgrade should avoid using --exec altogether. Instead, the --write-info-json or --dump-json options could be used, with an external script or command line consuming the JSON output. This is fixed in version 2025.07.21. | [1]https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/959ac99e98c3215437e573c22d64be42d361e863<br>[2]https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/tag/2025.07.21<br>[3]https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/security/advisories/GHSA-45hg-7f49-5h56 |
| 35 | CVE-2025-54137 | 7.3  | HIGH | HAX CMS NodeJS allows users to manage their microsite universe with a NodeJS backend. Versions 11.0.9 and below were distributed with hardcoded default credentials for the user and superuser accounts. Additionally, the application has default private keys for JWTs. Users aren`t prompted to change credentials or secrets during installation, and there is no way to change them through the UI. An unauthenticated attacker can read the default user credentials and JWT private keys from the public haxtheweb GitHub repositories. These credentials and keys can be used to access unconfigured self-hosted instances of the application, modify sites, and perform further attacks. This is fixed in version 11.0.10. | [1]https://github.com/haxtheweb/haxcms-nodejs/blob/main/src/lib/HAXCMS.js#L1614<br>[2]https://github.com/haxtheweb/haxcms-nodejs/commit/6dc2441c876350ca6fe9fbaecb058d92ef442869<br>[3]https://github.com/haxtheweb/issues/security/advisories/GHSA-5fpv-5qvh-7cf3 |
| 36 | CVE-2025-54138 | 7.5  | HIGH | LibreNMS is an auto-discovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring which includes support for a wide range of network hardware and operating systems. LibreNMS versions 25.6.0 and below contain an architectural vulnerability in the ajax_form.php endpoint that permits Remote File Inclusion based on user-controlled POST input. The application directly uses the type parameter to dynamically include .inc.php files from the trusted path includes/html/forms/, without validation or allowlisting. This pattern introduces a latent Remote Code Execution (RCE) vector if an attacker can stage a file in this include path â€” for example, via symlink, development misconfiguration, or chained vulnerabilities. This is fixed in version 25.7.0. | [1]https://github.com/librenms/librenms/commit/ec89714d929ef0cf2321957ed9198b0f18396c81<br>[2]https://github.com/librenms/librenms/pull/17990<br>[3]https://github.com/librenms/librenms/releases/tag/25.7.0<br>[4]https://github.com/librenms/librenms/security/advisories/GHSA-gq96-8w38-hhj2 |
