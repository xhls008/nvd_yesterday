| 1 | CVE-2024-32962 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | xml-crypto is an xml digital signature and encryption library for Node.js. In affected versions the default configuration does not check authorization of the signer, it only checks the validity of the signature per section 3.2.2 of the w3 xmldsig-core-20080610 spec. As such, without additional validation steps, the default configuration allows a malicious actor to re-sign an XML document, place the certificate in a `<KeyInfo />` element, and pass `xml-crypto` default validation checks. As a result `xml-crypto` trusts by default any certificate provided via digitally signed XML document`s `<KeyInfo />`. `xml-crypto` prefers to use any certificate provided via digitally signed XML document`s `<KeyInfo />` even if library was configured to use specific certificate (`publicCert`) for signature verification purposes.  An attacker can spoof signature verification by modifying XML document and replacing existing signature with signature generated with malicious private key (created by attacker) and by attaching that private key`s certificate to `<KeyInfo />` element. This vulnerability is combination of changes introduced to `4.0.0` on pull request 301 / commit `c2b83f98` and has been addressed in version 6.0.0 with pull request 445 / commit `21201723d`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may either check the certificate extracted via `getCertFromKeyInfo` against trusted certificates before accepting the results of the validation or set `xml-crypto`s getCertFromKeyInfo` to `() => undefined` forcing `xml-crypto` to use an explicitly configured `publicCert` or `privateKey` for signature verification. | [1]https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/commit/21201723d2ca9bc11288f62cf72552b7d659b000<br>[2]https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/commit/c2b83f984049edb68ad1d7c6ad0739ec92af11ca<br>[3]https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/pull/301<br>[4]https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/pull/445<br>[5]https://github.com/node-saml/xml-crypto/security/advisories/GHSA-2xp3-57p7-qf4v<br>[6]https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xmldsig-core-20080610/#sec-CoreValidation |
| 2 | CVE-2024-32971 | 9.0  | CRITICAL | Apollo Router is a configurable, graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation 2. The affected versions of Apollo Router contain a bug that in limited circumstances, could lead to unexpected operations being executed which can result in unintended data or effects. This only affects Router instances configured to use distributed query plan caching. The root cause of this defect is a bug in Apollo Router’s cache retrieval logic: When this defect is present and distributed query planning caching is enabled, asking the Router to execute an operation (whether it is a query, a mutation, or a subscription) may result in an unexpected variation of that operation being executed or the generation of unexpected errors. The issue stems from inadvertently executing a modified version of a previously executed operation, whose query plan is stored in the underlying cache (specifically, Redis). Depending on the type of the operation, the result may vary. For a query, results may be fetched that don’t match what was requested (e.g., rather than running `fetchUsers(type: ENTERPRISE)` the Router may run `fetchUsers(type: TRIAL)`. For a mutation, this may result in incorrect mutations being sent to underlying subgraph servers (e.g., rather than sending `deleteUser(id: 10)` to a subgraph, the Router may run `deleteUser(id: 12)`. Users who are using distributed query plan caching, are advised to either upgrade to version 1.45.1 or above or downgrade to version 1.43.2 of the Apollo Router. Apollo Router versions 1.44.0 or 1.45.0 are not recommended for use and have been withdrawn. Users unable to upgrade can disable distributed query plan caching to mitigate this issue. | [1]https://github.com/apollographql/router/commit/ff9f666598cd17661880fe7fc6e9c9611316e529<br>[2]https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases/tag/v1.45.1<br>[3]https://github.com/apollographql/router/security/advisories/GHSA-q9p4-hw9m-fj2v<br>[4]https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/distributed-caching/#distributed-query-plan-caching |
| 3 | CVE-2024-32114 | 8.5  | HIGH | In Apache ActiveMQ 6.x, the default configuration doesn`t secure the API web context (where the Jolokia JMX REST API and the Message REST API are located).It means that anyone can use these layers without any required authentication. Potentially, anyone can interact with the broker (using Jolokia JMX REST API) and/or produce/consume messages or purge/delete destinations (using the Message REST API).To mitigate, users can update the default conf/jetty.xml configuration file to add authentication requirement:<bean id="securityConstraintMapping" class="org.eclipse.jetty.security.ConstraintMapping">  <property name="constraint" ref="securityConstraint" />  <property name="pathSpec" value="/" /></bean>Or we encourage users to upgrade to Apache ActiveMQ 6.1.2 where the default configuration has been updated with authentication by default. | [1]https://activemq.apache.org/security-advisories.data/CVE-2024-32114-announcement.txt |
