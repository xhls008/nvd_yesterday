| 28 | CVE-2024-51479 | 7.5  | HIGH | Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. In affected versions if a Next.js application is performing authorization in middleware based on pathname, it was possible for this authorization to be bypassed for pages directly under the application`s root directory. For example: * [Not affected] `https://example.com/` * [Affected] `https://example.com/foo` * [Not affected] `https://example.com/foo/bar`. This issue is patched in Next.js `14.2.15` and later. If your Next.js application is hosted on Vercel, this vulnerability has been automatically mitigated, regardless of Next.js version. There are no official workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v14.2.15<br>[2]https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-7gfc-8cq8-jh5f |
| 29 | CVE-2024-9779 | 7.5  | HIGH | A flaw was found in Open Cluster Management (OCM) when a user has access to the worker nodes which contain the cluster-manager or klusterlet deployments. The cluster-manager deployment uses a service account with the same name "cluster-manager" which is bound to a ClusterRole also named "cluster-manager", which includes the permission to create Pod resources. If this deployment runs a pod on an attacker-controlled node, the attacker can obtain the cluster-manager`s token and steal any service account token by creating and mounting the target service account to control the whole cluster. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-9779<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2317916<br>[3]https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/ocm/pull/325<br>[4]https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/ocm/releases/tag/v0.13.0<br>[5]https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/registration-operator/issues/361 |
