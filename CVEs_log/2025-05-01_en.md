| 1 | CVE-2025-30202 | 7.5  | HIGH | vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs. Versions starting from 0.5.2 and prior to 0.8.5 are vulnerable to denial of service and data exposure via ZeroMQ on multi-node vLLM deployment. In a multi-node vLLM deployment, vLLM uses ZeroMQ for some multi-node communication purposes. The primary vLLM host opens an XPUB ZeroMQ socket and binds it to ALL interfaces. While the socket is always opened for a multi-node deployment, it is only used when doing tensor parallelism across multiple hosts. Any client with network access to this host can connect to this XPUB socket unless its port is blocked by a firewall. Once connected, these arbitrary clients will receive all of the same data broadcasted to all of the secondary vLLM hosts. This data is internal vLLM state information that is not useful to an attacker. By potentially connecting to this socket many times and not reading data published to them, an attacker can also cause a denial of service by slowing down or potentially blocking the publisher. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.5. | [1]https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/commit/a0304dc504c85f421d38ef47c64f83046a13641c<br>[2]https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/6183<br>[3]https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/GHSA-9f8f-2vmf-885j |
| 2 | CVE-2025-32444 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs. Versions starting from 0.6.5 and prior to 0.8.5, having vLLM integration with mooncake, are vulnerable to remote code execution due to using pickle based serialization over unsecured ZeroMQ sockets. The vulnerable sockets were set to listen on all network interfaces, increasing the likelihood that an attacker is able to reach the vulnerable ZeroMQ sockets to carry out an attack. vLLM instances that do not make use of the mooncake integration are not vulnerable. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.5. | [1]https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/32b14baf8a1f7195ca09484de3008063569b43c5/vllm/distributed/kv_transfer/kv_pipe/mooncake_pipe.py#L179<br>[2]https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/commit/a5450f11c95847cf51a17207af9a3ca5ab569b2c<br>[3]https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/GHSA-hj4w-hm2g-p6w5<br>[4]https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/GHSA-x3m8-f7g5-qhm7 |

| 22 | CVE-2025-27134 | 8.8  | HIGH | Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. Prior to version 3.3.3, a privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Joplin server, allowing non-admin users to exploit the API endpoint `PATCH /api/users/:id` to set the `is_admin` field to 1. The vulnerability allows malicious low-privileged users to perform administrative actions without proper authorization. This issue has been patched in version 3.3.3. | [1]https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/commit/12baa9827dac9da903f244c9f358e3deb264e228<br>[2]https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/security/advisories/GHSA-xj67-649m-3p8x<br>[3]https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/security/advisories/GHSA-xj67-649m-3p8x |
| 23 | CVE-2025-27409 | 7.5  | HIGH | Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. Prior to version 3.3.3, path traversal is possible in Joplin Server if static file path starts with `css/pluginAssets` or `js/pluginAssets`. The `findLocalFile` function in the `default route` calls `localFileFromUrl` to check for special `pluginAssets` paths. If the function returns a path, the result is returned directly, without checking for path traversal. The vulnerability allows attackers to read files outside the intended directories. This issue has been patched in version 3.3.3. | [1]https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11916<br>[2]https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/security/advisories/GHSA-5xv6-7jm3-fmg5<br>[3]https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/security/advisories/GHSA-5xv6-7jm3-fmg5 |
| 24 | CVE-2025-32973 | 9.0  | CRITICAL | XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 15.9-rc-1 to before 15.10.12, from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.4.3, and from 16.5.0-rc-1 to before 16.8.0-rc-1, when a user with programming rights edits a document in XWiki that was last edited by a user without programming rights and contains an XWiki.ComponentClass, there is no warning that this will grant programming rights to this object. An attacker who created such a malicious object could use this to gain programming rights on the wiki. For this, the attacker needs to have edit rights on at least one page to place this object and then get an admin user to edit that document. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.12, 16.4.3, and 16.8.0-rc-1. | [1]https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/1a6f1b2e050770331c9a63d12a3fd8a36d199f62<br>[2]https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-x7wv-5qg4-vmr6<br>[3]https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-22460<br>[4]https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-22460 |
| 25 | CVE-2025-32974 | 9.0  | CRITICAL | XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 15.9-rc-1 to before 15.10.8 and from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.2.0, the required rights analysis doesn`t consider TextAreas with default content type. When editing a page, XWiki warns since version 15.9 when there is content on the page like a script macro that would gain more rights due to the editing. This analysis doesn`t consider certain kinds of properties, allowing a user to put malicious scripts in there that will be executed after a user with script, admin, or programming rights edited the page. Such a malicious script could impact the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.8 and 16.2.0. | [1]https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/153dbfa2ef1a7a0a644fe3f889684c6a8738c5fc<br>[2]https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-mvgm-3rw2-7j4r<br>[3]https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-22002<br>[4]https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-22002 |
| 26 | CVE-2025-46342 | 8.5  | HIGH | Kyverno is a policy engine designed for cloud native platform engineering teams. Prior to versions 1.13.5 and 1.14.0, it may happen that policy rules using namespace selector(s) in their match statements are mistakenly not applied during admission review request processing due to a missing error propagation in function `GetNamespaceSelectorsFromNamespaceLister` in `pkg/utils/engine/labels.go`. As a consequence, security-critical mutations and validations are bypassed, potentially allowing attackers with K8s API access to perform malicious operations. This issue has been patched in versions 1.13.5 and 1.14.0. | [1]https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/commit/3ff923b7756e1681daf73849954bd88516589194<br>[2]https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/security/advisories/GHSA-jrr2-x33p-6hvc |
