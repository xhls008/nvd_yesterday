| 2 | CVE-2025-62164 | 8.8  | HIGH | vLLM is an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs). From versions 0.10.2 to before 0.11.1, a memory corruption vulnerability could lead to a crash (denial-of-service) and potentially remote code execution (RCE), exists in the Completions API endpoint. When processing user-supplied prompt embeddings, the endpoint loads serialized tensors using torch.load() without sufficient validation. Due to a change introduced in PyTorch 2.8.0, sparse tensor integrity checks are disabled by default. As a result, maliciously crafted tensors can bypass internal bounds checks and trigger an out-of-bounds memory write during the call to to_dense(). This memory corruption can crash vLLM and potentially lead to code execution on the server hosting vLLM. This issue has been patched in version 0.11.1. | [1]https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/commit/58fab50d82838d5014f4a14d991fdb9352c9c84b<br>[2]https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/27204<br>[3]https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/GHSA-mrw7-hf4f-83pf |

| 8 | CVE-2025-12138 | 8.8  | HIGH | The URL Image Importer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type validation in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.6. This is due to the plugin relying on a user-controlled Content-Type HTTP header to validate file uploads in the `uimptr_import_image_from_url()` function which writes the file to the server before performing proper validation. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible via the uploaded PHP file. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/url-image-importer/trunk/url-image-importer.php#L1319<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/url-image-importer/trunk/url-image-importer.php#L1353<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/url-image-importer/trunk/url-image-importer.php#L1358<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/url-image-importer/trunk/url-image-importer.php#L198<br>[5]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3395852%40url-image-importer&new=3395852%40url-image-importer&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=#file9<br>[6]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/1da18430-1bd0-4f63-9e22-5d26de2be410?source=cve |
| 9 | CVE-2025-13159 | 7.1  | HIGH | The Flo Forms – Easy Drag & Drop Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG file uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.43. This is due to the plugin allowing SVG file uploads via an unauthenticated AJAX endpoint (`flo_form_submit`) without proper file content validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload malicious SVG files containing JavaScript that executes when an administrator views the uploaded file in the WordPress admin interface, leading to potential full site compromise. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/flo-forms/trunk/admin/class-flo-forms-admin.php#L821<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/flo-forms/trunk/includes/class-flo-forms.php#L301<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/flo-forms/trunk/public/class-flo-forms-public.php#L502<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/8c529017-2fb9-4665-97a6-3ec062908299?source=cve |
| 10 | CVE-2025-13322 | 8.1  | HIGH | The WP AUDIO GALLERY plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in all versions up to, and including, 2.0. This is due to the `wpag_uploadaudio_callback()` AJAX handler not properly validating user-supplied file paths in the `audio_upload` parameter before passing them to `unlink()`. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when critical files like wp-config.php are deleted. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-audio-gallery/tags/2.0/wp-audio-gallery.php#L150<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-audio-gallery/tags/2.0/wp-audio-gallery.php#L513<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-audio-gallery/tags/2.0/wp-audio-gallery.php#L607<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/101675ae-88cf-42fc-b9ea-5dd37cdf7464?source=cve |
