| 18 | CVE-2025-59789 | 7.5  | HIGH | Uncontrolled recursion in the json2pb component in Apache bRPC (version < 1.15.0) on all platforms allows remote attackers to make the server crash via sending deep recursive json data.Root Cause:The bRPC json2pb component uses rapidjson to parse json data from the network. The rapidjson parser uses a recursive parsing method by default. If the input json has a large depth of recursive structure, the parser function may run into stack overflow.Affected Scenarios:Use bRPC server with protobuf message to serve http+json requests from untrusted network. Or directly use JsonToProtoMessage to convert json from untrusted input.How to Fix: (Choose one of the following options) 1. Upgrade bRPC to version 1.15.0, which fixes this issue.2. Apply this patch:  https://github.com/apache/brpc/pull/3099 Note:No matter which option you choose, you should know that the fix introduces a recursion depth limit with default value 100. It affects these functions: ProtoMessageToJson, ProtoMessageToProtoJson, JsonToProtoMessage, and ProtoJsonToProtoMessage. If your requests contain json or protobuf messages that have a depth exceeding the limit, the request will be failed after applying the fix. You can modify the gflag json2pb_max_recursion_depth to change the limit. | [1]https://lists.apache.org/thread/ozmcsztcpxn61jxod8jo8q46jo0oc1zx<br>[2]http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/12/01/1 |

| 52 | CVE-2025-66295 | 8.8  | HIGH | Grav is a file-based Web platform. Prior to 1.8.0-beta.27, when a user with privilege of user creation creates a new user through the Admin UI and supplies a username containing path traversal sequences (for example ..\Nijat or ../Nijat), Grav writes the account YAML file to an unintended path outside user/accounts/. The written YAML can contain account fields such as email, fullname, twofa_secret, and hashed_password. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.8.0-beta.27. | [1]https://github.com/getgrav/grav/commit/3462d94d575064601689b236508c316242e15741<br>[2]https://github.com/getgrav/grav/security/advisories/GHSA-h756-wh59-hhjv |
| 53 | CVE-2025-66296 | 8.8  | HIGH | Grav is a file-based Web platform. Prior to 1.8.0-beta.27, a privilege escalation vulnerability exists in Grav’s Admin plugin due to the absence of username uniqueness validation when creating users. A user with the create user permission can create a new account using the same username as an existing administrator account, set a new password/email, and then log in as that administrator. This effectively allows privilege escalation from limited user-manager permissions to full administrator access. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.8.0-beta.27. | [1]https://github.com/getgrav/grav/commit/3462d94d575064601689b236508c316242e15741<br>[2]https://github.com/getgrav/grav/security/advisories/GHSA-cjcp-qxvg-4rjm |
| 54 | CVE-2025-66299 | 8.8  | HIGH | Grav is a file-based Web platform. Prior to 1.8.0-beta.27, Grav CMS is vulnerable to a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) that allows any authenticated user with editor permissions to execute arbitrary code on the remote server, bypassing the existing security sandbox. Since the security sandbox does not fully protect the Twig object, it is possible to interact with it (e.g., call methods, read/write attributes) through maliciously crafted Twig template directives injected into a web page. This allows an authenticated editor to add arbitrary functions to the Twig attribute system.twig.safe_filters, effectively bypassing the Grav CMS sandbox. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.8.0-beta.27. | [1]https://github.com/getgrav/grav/commit/e37259527d9c1deb6200f8967197a9fa587c6458<br>[2]https://github.com/getgrav/grav/security/advisories/GHSA-gjc5-8cfh-653x |
| 55 | CVE-2025-66300 | 8.5  | HIGH | Grav is a file-based Web platform. Prior to 1.8.0-beta.27, A low privilege user account with page editing privilege can read any server files using "Frontmatter" form. This includes Grav user account files (/grav/user/accounts/*.yaml), which store hashed user password, 2FA secret, and the password reset token. This can allow an adversary to compromise any registered account by resetting a password for a user to get access to the password reset token from the file or by cracking the hashed password. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.8.0-beta.27. | [1]https://github.com/getgrav/grav/commit/ed640a13143c4177af013cf001969ed2c5e197ee<br>[2]https://github.com/getgrav/grav/security/advisories/GHSA-p4ww-mcp9-j6f2 |
| 56 | CVE-2025-66401 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | MCP Watch is a comprehensive security scanner for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. In 0.1.2 and earlier, the MCPScanner class contains a critical Command Injection vulnerability in the cloneRepo method. The application passes the user-supplied githubUrl argument directly to a system shell via execSync without sanitization. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host machine by appending shell metacharacters to the URL. | [1]https://github.com/kapilduraphe/mcp-watch/commit/e7da78c5b4b960f8b66c254059ad9ebc544a91a6<br>[2]https://github.com/kapilduraphe/mcp-watch/security/advisories/GHSA-27m7-ffhq-jqrm |
| 57 | CVE-2025-66448 | 7.1  | HIGH | vLLM is an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs). Prior to 0.11.1, vllm has a critical remote code execution vector in a config class named Nemotron_Nano_VL_Config. When vllm loads a model config that contains an auto_map entry, the config class resolves that mapping with get_class_from_dynamic_module(...) and immediately instantiates the returned class. This fetches and executes Python from the remote repository referenced in the auto_map string. Crucially, this happens even when the caller explicitly sets trust_remote_code=False in vllm.transformers_utils.config.get_config. In practice, an attacker can publish a benign-looking frontend repo whose config.json points via auto_map to a separate malicious backend repo; loading the frontend will silently run the backend’s code on the victim host. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.11.1. | [1]https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/commit/ffb08379d8870a1a81ba82b72797f196838d0c86<br>[2]https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/28126<br>[3]https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/GHSA-8fr4-5q9j-m8gm |
