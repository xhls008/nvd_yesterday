| 3 | CVE-2025-2929 | 7.1  | HIGH | The Order Delivery Date WordPress plugin before 12.4.0 does not sanitise and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin | [1]https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/e9299d8f-900b-4487-b135-b82946825e61/ |
| 4 | CVE-2025-4322 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Motors theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 5.6.67. This is due to the theme not properly validating a user`s identity prior to updating their password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user passwords, including those of administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account. | [1]http://themeforest.net/item/motors-car-dealership-wordpress-theme/13987211<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/61820ca5-5548-4155-b350-df3db1bc1661?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2025-30193 | 7.5  | HIGH | In some circumstances, when DNSdist is configured to allow an unlimited number of queries on a single, incoming TCP connection from a client, an attacker can cause a denial of service by crafting a TCP exchange that triggers an exhaustion of the stack and a crash of DNSdist, causing a denial of service.The remedy is: upgrade to the patched 1.9.10 version.A workaround is to restrict the maximum number of queries on incoming TCP connections to a safe value, like 50, via the setMaxTCPQueriesPerConnection setting.We would like to thank Renaud Allard for bringing this issue to our attention. | [1]https://dnsdist.org/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-for-dnsdist-2025-03.html |

| 11 | CVE-2025-47940 | 7.2  | HIGH | TYPO3 is an open source, PHP based web content management system. Starting in version 10.0.0 and prior to versions 10.4.50 ELTS, 11.5.44 ELTS, 12.4.31 LTS, and 13.4.12 LTS, administrator-level backend users without system maintainer privileges can escalate their privileges and gain system maintainer access. Exploiting this vulnerability requires a valid administrator account. Users should update to TYPO3 version 10.4.50 ELTS, 11.5.44 ELTS, 12.4.31 LTS, or 13.4.12 LTS to fix the problem. | [1]https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/security/advisories/GHSA-6frx-j292-c844<br>[2]https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2025-016 |
| 12 | CVE-2025-47941 | 7.2  | HIGH | TYPO3 is an open source, PHP based web content management system. In versions on the 12.x branch prior to 12.4.31 LTS and the 13.x branch prior to 13.4.2 LTS, the multifactor authentication (MFA) dialog presented during backend login can be bypassed due to insufficient enforcement of access restrictions on all backend routes. Successful exploitation requires valid backend user credentials, as MFA can only be bypassed after successful authentication. Users should update to TYPO3 version 12.4.31 LTS or 13.4.12 LTS to fix the problem. | [1]https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/security/advisories/GHSA-744g-7qm9-hjh9<br>[2]https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2025-015 |

| 18 | CVE-2025-46724 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Langroid is a Python framework to build large language model (LLM)-powered applications. Prior to version 0.53.15, `TableChatAgent` uses `pandas eval()`. If fed by untrusted user input, like the case of a public-facing LLM application, it may be vulnerable to code injection. Langroid 0.53.15 sanitizes input to `TableChatAgent` by default to tackle the most common attack vectors, and added several warnings about the risky behavior in the project documentation. | [1]https://github.com/langroid/langroid/commit/0d9e4a7bb3ae2eef8d38f2e970ff916599a2b2a6<br>[2]https://github.com/langroid/langroid/security/advisories/GHSA-jqq5-wc57-f8hj<br>[3]https://github.com/langroid/langroid/security/advisories/GHSA-jqq5-wc57-f8hj |
| 19 | CVE-2025-47277 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | vLLM, an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs), has an issue in versions 0.6.5 through 0.8.4 that ONLY impacts environments using the `PyNcclPipe` KV cache transfer integration with the V0 engine. No other configurations are affected. vLLM supports the use of the `PyNcclPipe` class to establish a peer-to-peer communication domain for data transmission between distributed nodes. The GPU-side KV-Cache transmission is implemented through the `PyNcclCommunicator` class, while CPU-side control message passing is handled via the `send_obj` and `recv_obj` methods on the CPU side.​ The intention was that this interface should only be exposed to a private network using the IP address specified by the `--kv-ip` CLI parameter. The vLLM documentation covers how this must be limited to a secured network. The default and intentional behavior from PyTorch is that the `TCPStore` interface listens on ALL interfaces, regardless of what IP address is provided. The IP address given was only used as a client-side address to use. vLLM was fixed to use a workaround to force the `TCPStore` instance to bind its socket to a specified private interface. As of version 0.8.5, vLLM limits the `TCPStore` socket to the private interface as configured. | [1]https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/deployment/security.html<br>[2]https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/commit/0d6e187e88874c39cda7409cf673f9e6546893e7<br>[3]https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/15988<br>[4]https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/GHSA-hjq4-87xh-g4fv |
