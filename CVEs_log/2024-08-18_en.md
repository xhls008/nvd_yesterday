| 1 | CVE-2024-6500 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | The InPost for WooCommerce plugin and InPost PL plugin for WordPress are vulnerable to unauthorized access and deletion of data due to a missing capability check on the `parse_request` function in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.0 (for InPost for WooCommerce) as well as 1.4.4 (for InPost PL). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read and delete arbitrary files on Windows servers. On Linux servers, only files within the WordPress install will be deleted, but all files can be read. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/inpost-for-woocommerce/trunk/src/InspireLabs/WoocommerceInpost/EasyPack_Helper.php#L267<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/inpost-for-woocommerce/trunk/src/InspireLabs/WoocommerceInpost/EasyPack_Helper.php#L75<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woo-inpost/trunk/classes/class-helper.php#L140<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woo-inpost/trunk/classes/class-helper.php#L216<br>[5]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3115602%40inpost-for-woocommerce%2Ftrunk&old=3110579%40inpost-for-woocommerce%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[6]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3125034%40woo-inpost%2Ftrunk&old=2886304%40woo-inpost%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[7]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/7b57e750-71ec-4c52-999b-6c14a78c3bff?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2022-1751 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Skitter Slideshow plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.2 via the /image.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and modify information from internal services. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-skitter-slideshow/trunk/image.php<br>[2]https://securityforeveryone.com/blog/wordpress-skitter-slideshow-ssrf-0-day-vulnerability-cve-2022-1751<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/175eba7e-454b-4ba3-bbb5-22bd56734f5c?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2023-0714 | 8.1  | HIGH | The Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Upload due to insufficient file type validation in versions up to, and including, 3.2.4. This allows unauthenticated visitors to perform a "double extension" attack and upload files containing a malicious extension but ending with a benign extension, which may make remote code execution possible in some configurations. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/metform/trunk/core/entries/file-data-validation.php?rev=2746287<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2896914/<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/697ce433-f321-4977-a2ad-68369d9ce9c3?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2023-3416 | 7.2  | HIGH | The tagDiv Opt-In Builder plugin is vulnerable to Blind SQL Injection via the `subscriptionCouponId` parameter via the `create_stripe_subscription` REST API endpoint in versions up to, and including, 1.4.4 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrator-level privileges to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-opt-in-builder/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/7659ac9b-fa4e-4cb7-9887-38aa65b6d1c3?source=cve |

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrator-level privileges to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://tagdiv.com/tagdiv-opt-in-builder/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/17150263-261d-422f-8b36-a2981d4aaad3?source=cve |
