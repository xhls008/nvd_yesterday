| 17 | CVE-2025-50460 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in the ms-swift project version 3.3.0 due to unsafe deserialization in tests/run.py using yaml.load() from the PyYAML library (versions = 5.3.1). If an attacker can control the content of the YAML configuration file passed to the --run_config parameter, arbitrary code can be executed during deserialization. This can lead to full system compromise. The vulnerability is triggered when a malicious YAML file is loaded, allowing the execution of arbitrary Python commands such as os.system(). It is recommended to upgrade PyYAML to version 5.4 or higher, and to use yaml.safe_load() to mitigate the issue. | [1]https://github.com/Anchor0221/CVE-2025-50460<br>[2]https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6757-jp84-gxfx<br>[3]https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift<br>[4]https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift/blob/main/tests/run.py#L420<br>[5]https://github.com/Anchor0221/CVE-2025-50460 |
| 18 | CVE-2025-50472 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The modelscope/ms-swift library thru 2.6.1 is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution through deserialization of untrusted data within the `load_model_meta()` function of the `ModelFileSystemCache()` class. Attackers can execute arbitrary code and commands by crafting a malicious serialized `.mdl` payload, exploiting the use of `pickle.load()` on data from potentially untrusted sources. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution (RCE) by deceiving victims into loading a seemingly harmless checkpoint during a normal training process, thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the targeted machine. Note that the payload file is a hidden file, making it difficult for the victim to detect tampering. More importantly, during the model training process, after the `.mdl` file is loaded and executes arbitrary code, the normal training process remains unaffected`meaning the user remains unaware of the arbitrary code execution. | [1]https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift/blob/ab38bff0387a86fd9f068246c326ee7b0d5ed139/swift/hub/utils/caching.py#L141<br>[2]https://github.com/xhjy2020/CVE-2025-50472 |
| 19 | CVE-2025-52390 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | Saurus CMS Community Edition since commit d886e5b0 (2010-04-23) is vulnerable to a SQL Injection vulnerability in the `prepareSearchQuery()` method in `FulltextSearch.class.php`. The application directly concatenates user-supplied input (`$search_word`) into SQL queries without sanitization, allowing attackers to manipulate the SQL logic and potentially extract sensitive information or escalate their privileges. | [1]https://github.com/sauruscms/Saurus-CMS-Community-Edition/blob/d886e5b0c1e2b42cd74e2184e7c81c720cd9de6b/classes/FulltextSearch.class.php#L331<br>[2]https://github.com/theharshkothari/vulnerability-research/blob/main/CVE-2025-52390.md |

| 23 | CVE-2025-2824 | 7.4  | HIGH | IBM Operational Decision Manager 8.11.0.1, 8.11.1.0, 8.12.0.1, 9.0.0.1, and 9.5.0 could allow a remote attacker to conduct phishing attacks, using an open redirect attack. By persuading a victim to visit a specially crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to spoof the URL displayed to redirect a user to a malicious Web site that would appear to be trusted. This could allow the attacker to obtain highly sensitive information or conduct further attacks against the victim. | [1]https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/7241286 |
| 24 | CVE-2025-50870 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Institute-of-Current-Students 1.0 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control in the mydetailsstudent.php endpoint. The myds GET parameter accepts an email address as input and directly returns the corresponding student`s personal information without validating the identity or permissions of the requesting user. This allows any authenticated or unauthenticated attacker to enumerate and retrieve sensitive student details by altering the email value in the request URL, leading to information disclosure. | [1]https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html<br>[2]https://gist.github.com/b0mk35h/c4d47b5c4aacecdc8e6c4b02b40ce302 |

| 27 | CVE-2025-54593 | 7.2  | HIGH | FreshRSS is a free, self-hostable RSS aggregator. In versions 1.26.1 and below, an authenticated administrator user can execute arbitrary code on the FreshRSS server by modifying the update URL to one they control, and gain code execution after running an update. After successfully executing code, user data including hashed passwords can be exfiltrated, the instance can be defaced when file permissions allow. Malicious code can be inserted into the instance to steal plaintext passwords, among others. This is fixed in version 1.26.2. | [1]https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/commit/dbdadbb4107878d9233f635c31a88afe45957101<br>[2]https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/pull/7477<br>[3]https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/releases/tag/1.26.2<br>[4]https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/security/advisories/GHSA-jcww-48g9-wf57 |
| 28 | CVE-2025-54595 | 7.3  | HIGH | Pearcleaner is a free, source-available and fair-code licensed mac app cleaner. The PearcleanerHelper is a privileged helper tool bundled with the Pearcleaner application. It is registered and activated only after the user approves a system prompt to allow privileged operations. Upon approval, the helper is configured as a LaunchDaemon and runs with root privileges. In versions 4.4.0 through 4.5.1, the helper registers an XPC service (com.alienator88.Pearcleaner.PearcleanerHelper) and accepts unauthenticated connections from any local process. It exposes a method that executes arbitrary shell commands. This allows any local unprivileged user to escalate privileges to root once the helper is approved and active. This issue is fixed in version 4.5.2. | [1]https://github.com/alienator88/Pearcleaner/commit/69afadfa95791cb998118ca35c227007b230b984<br>[2]https://github.com/alienator88/Pearcleaner/issues/278<br>[3]https://github.com/alienator88/Pearcleaner/releases/tag/4.5.2<br>[4]https://github.com/alienator88/Pearcleaner/security/advisories/GHSA-gr2j-65fh-8pvc |

| 31 | CVE-2025-54424 | 8.1  | HIGH | 1Panel is a web interface and MCP Server that manages websites, files, containers, databases, and LLMs on a Linux server. In versions 2.0.5 and below, the HTTPS protocol used for communication between the Core and Agent endpoints has incomplete certificate verification during certificate validation, leading to unauthorized interface access. Due to the presence of numerous command execution or high-privilege interfaces in 1Panel, this results in Remote Code Execution (RCE). This is fixed in version 2.0.6. The CVE has been translated from Simplified Chinese using GitHub Copilot. | [1]https://github.com/1Panel-dev/1Panel/pull/9698/commits/4003284521f8d31ddaf7215d1c30ab8b4cdb0261<br>[2]https://github.com/1Panel-dev/1Panel/releases/tag/v2.0.6<br>[3]https://github.com/1Panel-dev/1Panel/security/advisories/GHSA-8j63-96wh-wh3j |
