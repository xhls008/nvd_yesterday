| 5 | CVE-2026-23962 | 7.5  | HIGH | Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. Mastodon versions before v4.3.18, v4.4.12, and v4.5.5 do not have a limit on the maximum number of poll options for remote posts, allowing attackers to create polls with a very large amount of options, greatly increasing resource consumption. Depending on the number of poll options, an attacker can cause disproportionate resource usage in both Mastodon servers and clients, potentially causing Denial of Service either server-side or client-side. Mastodon versions v4.5.5, v4.4.12, v4.3.18 are patched. | [1]https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.3.18<br>[2]https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.4.12<br>[3]https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.5.5<br>[4]https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-gg8q-rcg7-p79g |
| 6 | CVE-2026-23965 | 7.5  | HIGH | sm-crypto provides JavaScript implementations of the Chinese cryptographic algorithms SM2, SM3, and SM4. A signature forgery vulnerability exists in the SM2 signature verification logic of sm-crypto prior to version 0.4.0.

| 9 | CVE-2026-24002 | 9.0  | CRITICAL | Grist is spreadsheet software using Python as its formula language. Grist offers several methods for running those formulas in a sandbox, for cases where the user may be working with untrusted spreadsheets. One such method runs them in pyodide, but pyodide on node does not have a useful sandbox barrier. If a user of Grist sets `GRIST_SANDBOX_FLAVOR` to `pyodide` and opens a malicious document, that document could run arbitrary processes on the server hosting Grist. The problem has been addressed in Grist version 1.7.9 and up, by running pyodide under deno. As a workaround, a user can use the gvisor-based sandbox by setting  `GRIST_SANDBOX_FLAVOR` to `gvisor`. | [1]https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/security/advisories/GHSA-7xvx-8pf2-pv5g<br>[2]https://support.getgrist.com/self-managed/#how-do-i-sandbox-documents |
| 10 | CVE-2026-24006 | 7.5  | HIGH | Seroval facilitates JS value stringification, including complex structures beyond JSON.stringify capabilities. In versions 1.4.0and below, serialization of objects with extreme depth can exceed the maximum call stack limit. In version 1.4.1, Seroval introduces a `depthLimit` parameter in serialization/deserialization methods. An error will be thrown if the depth limit is reached. | [1]https://github.com/lxsmnsyc/seroval/commit/ce9408ebc87312fcad345a73c172212f2a798060<br>[2]https://github.com/lxsmnsyc/seroval/security/advisories/GHSA-3j22-8qj3-26mx |
| 11 | CVE-2026-24038 | 8.1  | HIGH | Horilla is a free and open source Human Resource Management System (HRMS). In version 1.4.0, the OTP handling logic has a flawed equality check that can be bypassed. When an OTP expires, the server returns None, and if an attacker omits the otp field from their POST request, the user-supplied OTP is also None, causing the comparison user_otp == otp to pass. This allows an attacker to bypass two-factor authentication entirely without ever providing a valid OTP. If administrative accounts are targeted, it could lead to compromise of sensitive HR data, manipulation of employee records, and further system-wide abuse. This issue has been fixed in version 1.5.0. | [1]https://github.com/horilla-opensource/horilla/releases/tag/1.5.0<br>[2]https://github.com/horilla-opensource/horilla/security/advisories/GHSA-hqpv-ff5v-3hwf |
| 12 | CVE-2026-24042 | 9.4  | CRITICAL | Appsmith is a platform to build admin panels, internal tools, and dashboards. In versions 1.94 and below, publicly accessible apps allow unauthenticated users to execute unpublished (edit-mode) actions by sending viewMode=false (or omitting it) to POST /api/v1/actions/execute. This bypasses the expected publish boundary where public viewers should only execute published actions, not edit-mode versions. An attack can result in sensitive data exposure, execution of edit‑mode queries and APIs, development data access, and the ability to trigger side effect behavior. This issue does not have a released fix at the time of publication. | [1]https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/security/advisories/GHSA-j9qq-4fj9-9883 |
| 13 | CVE-2026-24049 | 7.1  | HIGH | wheel is a command line tool for manipulating Python wheel files, as defined in PEP 427. In versions 0.46.1 and below, the unpack function is vulnerable to file permission modification through mishandling of file permissions after extraction. The logic blindly trusts the filename from the archive header for the chmod operation, even though the extraction process itself might have sanitized the path. Attackers can craft a malicious wheel file that, when unpacked, changes the permissions of critical system files (e.g., /etc/passwd, SSH keys, config files), allowing for Privilege Escalation or arbitrary code execution by modifying now-writable scripts. This issue has been fixed in version 0.46.2. | [1]https://github.com/pypa/wheel/commit/7a7d2de96b22a9adf9208afcc9547e1001569fef<br>[2]https://github.com/pypa/wheel/releases/tag/0.46.2<br>[3]https://github.com/pypa/wheel/security/advisories/GHSA-8rrh-rw8j-w5fx |

| 32 | CVE-2026-24009 | 8.1  | HIGH | Docling Core (or docling-core) is a library that defines core data types and transformations in the document processing application Docling. A PyYAML-related Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability, namely CVE-2020-14343, is exposed in docling-core starting in version 2.21.0 and prior to version 2.48.4, specifically only if the application uses pyyaml prior to version 5.4 and invokes `docling_core.types.doc.DoclingDocument.load_from_yaml()` passing it untrusted YAML data. The vulnerability has been patched in docling-core version 2.48.4. The fix mitigates the issue by switching `PyYAML` deserialization from `yaml.FullLoader` to `yaml.SafeLoader`, ensuring that untrusted data cannot trigger code execution. Users who cannot immediately upgrade docling-core can alternatively ensure that the installed version of PyYAML is 5.4 or greater. | [1]https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8q59-q68h-6hv4<br>[2]https://github.com/docling-project/docling-core/commit/3e8d628eeeae50f0f8f239c8c7fea773d065d80c<br>[3]https://github.com/docling-project/docling-core/issues/482<br>[4]https://github.com/docling-project/docling-core/releases/tag/v2.48.4<br>[5]https://github.com/docling-project/docling-core/security/advisories/GHSA-vqxf-v2gg-x3hc |

| 39 | CVE-2026-23953 | 8.7  | HIGH | Incus is a system container and virtual machine manager. In versions 6.20.0 and below, a user with the ability to launch a container with a custom YAML configuration (e.g a member of the ‘incus’ group) can create an environment variable containing newlines, which can be used to add additional configuration items in the container’s lxc.conf due to newline injection. This can allow adding arbitrary lifecycle hooks, ultimately resulting in arbitrary command execution on the host. Exploiting this issue on IncusOS requires a slight modification of the payload to change to a different writable directory for the validation step (e.g /tmp). This can be confirmed with a second container with /tmp mounted from the host (A privileged action for validation only). A fix is planned for versions 6.0.6and 6.21.0, but they have not been released at the time of publication. | [1]https://github.com/lxc/incus/blob/HEAD/internal/server/instance/drivers/driver_lxc.go#L1081<br>[2]https://github.com/lxc/incus/security/advisories/GHSA-x6jc-phwx-hp32<br>[3]https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24473682/environment_newline_injection.sh<br>[4]https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24473685/environment_newline_injection.patch |
| 40 | CVE-2026-23954 | 8.7  | HIGH | Incus is a system container and virtual machine manager. Versions 6.21.0 and below allow a user with the ability to launch a container with a custom image (e.g a member of the ‘incus’ group) to use directory traversal or symbolic links in the templating functionality to achieve host arbitrary file read, and host arbitrary file write. This ultimately results in arbitrary command execution on the host. When using an image with a metadata.yaml containing templates, both the source and target paths are not checked for symbolic links or directory traversal. This can also be exploited in IncusOS. A fix is planned for versions 6.0.6 and 6.21.0, but they have not been released at the time of publication. | [1]https://github.com/lxc/incus/blob/HEAD/internal/server/instance/drivers/driver_lxc.go#L7215<br>[2]https://github.com/lxc/incus/blob/HEAD/internal/server/instance/drivers/driver_lxc.go#L7294<br>[3]https://github.com/lxc/incus/security/advisories/GHSA-7f67-crqm-jgh7<br>[4]https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24473599/template_arbitrary_write.sh<br>[5]https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24473601/templates_arbitrary_write.patch |
| 41 | CVE-2026-23988 | 7.3  | HIGH | Rufus is a utility that helps format and create bootable USB flash drives. Versions 4.11 and below contain a race condition (TOCTOU) in src/net.c during the creation, validation, and execution of the Fido PowerShell script. Since Rufus runs with elevated privileges (Administrator) but writes the script to the %TEMP% directory (writeable by standard users) without locking the file, a local attacker can replace the legitimate script with a malicious one between the file write operation and the execution step. This allows arbitrary code execution with Administrator privileges. This issue has been fixed in version 4.12_BETA. | [1]https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/commit/460cc5768aa45be07941b9e4ebc9bee02d282873<br>[2]https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases/tag/v4.12_BETA<br>[3]https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/security/advisories/GHSA-hcx5-hrhj-xhq9 |
| 42 | CVE-2025-53968 | 7.5  | HIGH | This vulnerability arises because there are no limitations on the number of authentication attempts a user can make. An attacker can exploit this weakness by continuously sending authentication requests, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This can overwhelm the authentication system, rendering it unavailable to legitimate users and potentially causing service disruption. This can also allow attackers to conduct brute-force attacks to gain unauthorized access. | [1]https://github.com/cisagov/CSAF/blob/develop/csaf_files/OT/white/2026/icsa-26-022-08.json<br>[2]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-26-022-08 |
| 43 | CVE-2025-54816 | 9.4  | CRITICAL | This vulnerability occurs when a WebSocket endpoint does not enforce proper authentication mechanisms, allowing unauthorized users to establish connections. As a result, attackers can exploit this weakness to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions. Given that no authentication is required, this can lead to privilege escalation and potentially compromise the security of the entire system. | [1]https://github.com/cisagov/CSAF/blob/develop/csaf_files/OT/white/2026/icsa-26-022-08.json<br>[2]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-26-022-08 |
| 44 | CVE-2025-55705 | 7.3  | HIGH | This vulnerability occurs when the system permits multiple simultaneous connections to the backend using the same charging station ID. This can result in unauthorized access, data inconsistency, or potential manipulation of charging sessions. The lack of proper session management and expiration control allows attackers to exploit this weakness by reusing valid charging station IDs to establish multiple sessions concurrently. | [1]https://github.com/cisagov/CSAF/blob/develop/csaf_files/OT/white/2026/icsa-26-022-08.json<br>[2]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-26-022-08 |

| 50 | CVE-2026-24129 | 8.0  | HIGH | Runtipi is a Docker-based, personal homeserver orchestrator that facilitates multiple services on a single server. Versions 3.7.0 and above allow an authenticated user to execute arbitrary system commands on the host server by injecting shell metacharacters into backup filenames. The BackupManager fails to sanitize the filenames of uploaded backups. The system persists user-uploaded files directly to the host filesystem using the raw originalname provided in the request. This allows an attacker to stage a file containing shell metacharacters (e.g., $(id).tar.gz) at a predictable path, which is later referenced during the restore process. The successful storage of the file is what allows the subsequent restore command to reference and execute it. This issue has been fixed in version 4.7.0. | [1]https://github.com/runtipi/runtipi/commit/c3aa948885554a370d374692158a3bfe1cfdc85a<br>[2]https://github.com/runtipi/runtipi/releases/tag/v4.7.0<br>[3]https://github.com/runtipi/runtipi/security/advisories/GHSA-vrgf-rcj5-6gv9 |
