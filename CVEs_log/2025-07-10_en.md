|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2025-4828 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Support Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the sb_file_delete function in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.0. This makes it possible for attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). An attacker can leverage CVE-2025-4855 vulnerability to exploit this vulnerability unauthenticated. | [1]https://codecanyon.net/item/support-board-help-desk-and-chat/20359943<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/33989611-8640-4c33-a34e-14f10cd7286d?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2025-4855 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Support Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access/modification/deletion of data due to use of hardcoded default secrets in the sb_encryption() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass authorization and execute arbitrary AJAX actions defined in the sb_ajax_execute() function. An attacker can use this vulnerability to exploit CVE-2025-4828 and various other functions unauthenticated. | [1]https://codecanyon.net/item/support-board-help-desk-and-chat/20359943<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/afd48bc8-d490-4a3e-97fc-70cf008cbf66?source=cve |

| 8 | CVE-2025-6691 | 8.1  | HIGH | The SureForms – Drag and Drop Form Builder for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the delete_entry_files() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/sureforms/trunk/admin/views/entries-list-table.php#L661<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3319753%40sureforms&new=3319753%40sureforms&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[3]https://wordpress.org/plugins/sureforms/<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b4658546-bf57-414b-a3c9-bf7a5692c5fe?source=cve |
| 9 | CVE-2025-6742 | 7.5  | HIGH | The SureForms – Drag and Drop Form Builder for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.3 via the use of file_exists() in the delete_entry_files() function without restriction on the path provided. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object.

By exploiting the vulnerability is possible to exfiltrate GITHUB_TOKEN which has high privileges. GITHUB_TOKEN can be used to completely overtake the repo since the token has content write privileges. This vulnerability is fixed in commit 585c6a591440cd39f92374230ac5d65d7dd23d6a. | [1]https://github.com/RSSNext/Folo/commit/585c6a591440cd39f92374230ac5d65d7dd23d6a<br>[2]https://github.com/RSSNext/Folo/security/advisories/GHSA-h87r-5w74-qfm4<br>[3]https://github.com/RSSNext/Folo/security/advisories/GHSA-h87r-5w74-qfm4 |
