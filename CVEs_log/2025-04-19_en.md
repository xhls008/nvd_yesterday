| 9 | CVE-2025-29784 | 7.5  | HIGH | NamelessMC is a free, easy to use & powerful website software for Minecraft servers. In version 2.1.4 and prior, the s parameter in GET requests for forum search functionality lacks length validation, allowing attackers to submit excessively long search queries. This oversight can lead to performance degradation and potential denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.0. | [1]https://github.com/NamelessMC/Nameless/commit/f5341e56930a98978171e0a871d60f19ab30ebdd<br>[2]https://github.com/NamelessMC/Nameless/releases/tag/v2.2.0<br>[3]https://github.com/NamelessMC/Nameless/security/advisories/GHSA-4hrq-rf96-c2jm<br>[4]https://github.com/NamelessMC/Nameless/security/advisories/GHSA-4hrq-rf96-c2jm |
| 10 | CVE-2025-30158 | 7.1  | HIGH | NamelessMC is a free, easy to use & powerful website software for Minecraft servers. In version 2.1.4 and prior, the forum allows users to post iframe elements inside forum topics/comments/feed with no restriction on the iframe`s width and height attributes. This allows an authenticated attacker to perform a UI-based denial of service (DoS) by injecting oversized iframes that block the forum UI and disrupt normal user interactions. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.0. | [1]https://github.com/NamelessMC/Nameless/commit/caa42a975338a13fbc1658e8c440108f16135643<br>[2]https://github.com/NamelessMC/Nameless/releases/tag/v2.2.0<br>[3]https://github.com/NamelessMC/Nameless/security/advisories/GHSA-2prx-rgr7-hq5f<br>[4]https://github.com/NamelessMC/Nameless/security/advisories/GHSA-2prx-rgr7-hq5f |
| 11 | CVE-2025-30357 | 7.3  | HIGH | NamelessMC is a free, easy to use & powerful website software for Minecraft servers. In version 2.1.4 and prior, if a malicious user is leaving spam comments on many topics then an administrator, unable to manually remove each spam comment, may delete the malicious account. Once an administrator deletes the malicious user`s account, all their posts (comments) along with the associated topics (by unrelated users) will be marked as deleted. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.0. | [1]https://github.com/NamelessMC/Nameless/commit/7040924e27f99aa486c619a5b4ca809051a1ca7f<br>[2]https://github.com/NamelessMC/Nameless/releases/tag/v2.2.0<br>[3]https://github.com/NamelessMC/Nameless/security/advisories/GHSA-22mc-7c9m-gv8h |
| 12 | CVE-2025-31118 | 7.1  | HIGH | NamelessMC is a free, easy to use & powerful website software for Minecraft servers. In version 2.1.4 and prior, forum quick reply feature (view_topic.php) does not implement any spam prevention mechanism. This allows authenticated users to continuously post replies without any time restriction, resulting in an uncontrolled surge of posts that can disrupt normal operations. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.0. | [1]https://github.com/NamelessMC/Nameless/commit/51e9d93aaa28d40f060b807533d22b768abea207<br>[2]https://github.com/NamelessMC/Nameless/releases/tag/v2.2.0<br>[3]https://github.com/NamelessMC/Nameless/security/advisories/GHSA-jhvp-mwj4-922m<br>[4]https://github.com/NamelessMC/Nameless/security/advisories/GHSA-jhvp-mwj4-922m |
| 13 | CVE-2025-32442 | 7.5  | HIGH | Fastify is a fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js. In versions 5.0.0 to 5.3.0, applications that specify different validation strategies for different content types have a possibility to bypass validation by providing a _slightly altered_ content type such as with different casing or altered whitespacing before `;`. This was patched in v5.3.1, but the initial patch did not cover all problems. This has been fully patched in v5.3.2. A workaround involves not specifying individual content types in the schema. | [1]https://github.com/fastify/fastify/commit/436da4c06dfbbb8c24adee3a64de0c51e4f47418<br>[2]https://github.com/fastify/fastify/commit/f3d2bcb3963cd570a582e5d39aab01a9ae692fe4<br>[3]https://github.com/fastify/fastify/security/advisories/GHSA-mg2h-6x62-wpwc<br>[4]https://hackerone.com/reports/3087928 |
| 14 | CVE-2025-24914 | 7.8  | HIGH | When installing Nessus to a non-default location on a Windows host, Nessus versions prior to 10.8.4 did not enforce secure permissions for sub-directories. This could allow for local privilege escalation if users had not secured the directories in the non-default installation location. - CVE-2025-24914 | [1]https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2025-05 |
| 15 | CVE-2025-32953 | 8.7  | HIGH | z80pack is a mature emulator of multiple platforms with 8080 and Z80 CPU. In version 1.38 and prior, the `makefile-ubuntu.yml` workflow file uses `actions/upload-artifact@v4` to upload the `z80pack-ubuntu` artifact. This artifact is a zip of the current directory, which includes the automatically generated `.git/config` file containing the run`s GITHUB_TOKEN. Seeing as the artifact can be downloaded prior to the end of the workflow, there is a few seconds where an attacker can extract the token from the artifact and use it with the Github API to push malicious code or rewrite release commits in your repository. This issue has been fixed in commit bd95916. | [1]https://github.com/udo-munk/z80pack/commit/1e06c2fe498ca772002b5c4f6f9e3085061e47da<br>[2]https://github.com/udo-munk/z80pack/commit/836c2e37b54f86bb4bed9e1406b67e52aa52308d<br>[3]https://github.com/udo-munk/z80pack/commit/95535987d690bd20849fbf143f267283f0e2db91<br>[4]https://github.com/udo-munk/z80pack/commit/bd9591615ae7b1e6229aa60a485447441c4a0c15<br>[5]https://github.com/udo-munk/z80pack/security/advisories/GHSA-gpjj-f76m-9x3q |
