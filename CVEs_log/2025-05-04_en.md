| 1 | CVE-2025-3918 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Job Listings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to improper authorization within the register_action() function in versions 0.1 to 0.1.1. The pluginâ€™s registration handler reads the client-supplied $_POST[`user_role`] and passes it directly to wp_insert_user() without restricting to a safe set of roles.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to elevate their privileges to that of an administrator. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/job-listings/trunk/includes/forms/class-jlt-form-member.php#L68<br>[2]https://wordpress.org/plugins/job-listings/#developers<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c9cd43f5-c3d0-4eb2-9c18-1af2edca37ff?source=cve |
