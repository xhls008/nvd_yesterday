| 1 | CVE-2026-24399 | 9.3  | CRITICAL | ChatterMate is a no-code AI chatbot agent framework. In versions 1.0.8 and below, the chatbot accepts and executes malicious HTML/JavaScript payloads when supplied as chat input. Specifically, an <iframe> payload containing a javascript: URI can be processed and executed in the browser context. This allows access to sensitive client-side data such as localStorage tokens and cookies, resulting in client-side injection. This issue has been fixed in version 1.0.9. | [1]https://github.com/chattermate/chattermate.chat/commit/ff3398031abb97ae28546eaf993fed3619eaffdd<br>[2]https://github.com/chattermate/chattermate.chat/releases/tag/v1.0.9<br>[3]https://github.com/chattermate/chattermate.chat/security/advisories/GHSA-72p3-w95w-q3j4 |
| 2 | CVE-2026-24403 | 7.1  | HIGH | iccDEV provides libraries and tools for interacting with, manipulating, and applying ICC color management profiles. In versions 2.3.1.1 and below, an integer overflow vulnerability exists in icValidateStatus CIccProfile::CheckHeader() when user-controllable input is incorporated into profile data unsafely. Tampering with tag tables, offsets, or size fields can trigger parsing errors, memory corruption, or DoS, potentially enabling arbitrary Code Execution or bypassing application logic. This issue has been fixed in version 2.3.1.2. | [1]https://github.com/InternationalColorConsortium/iccDEV/commits/d993997005449a0a6958e65b057bd25e17dff89<br>[2]https://github.com/InternationalColorConsortium/iccDEV/issues/505<br>[3]https://github.com/InternationalColorConsortium/iccDEV/security/advisories/GHSA-ph33-qp8j-5q34 |

| 11 | CVE-2026-24469 | 7.5  | HIGH | C++ HTTP Server is an HTTP/1.1 server built to handle client connections and serve HTTP requests. Versions 1.0 and below are vulnerable to Path Traversal via the RequestHandler::handleRequest method. This flaw allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to read arbitrary files from the server`s filesystem by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request containing ../ sequences. The application fails to sanitize the filename variable derived from the user-controlled URL path, directly concatenating it to the files_directory base path and enabling traversal outside the intended root. No patch was available at the time of publication. | [1]https://github.com/frustratedProton/http-server/security/advisories/GHSA-qp54-6gfq-3gff |
| 12 | CVE-2025-13374 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Kalrav AI Agent plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the kalrav_upload_file AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://github.com/d0n601/CVE-2025-13374<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/kalrav-ai-agent/tags/2.3.3/kalrav-ai-agent.php#L967<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/kalrav-ai-agent/trunk/kalrav-ai-agent.php#L967<br>[4]https://ryankozak.com/posts/cve-2025-13374<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/5dc8feae-fc89-4152-b9b2-2b70e6ccb30b?source=cve |
| 13 | CVE-2026-0807 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Frontis Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.6. This is due to insufficient restriction on the `url` parameter in the `template_proxy` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application via the `/template-proxy/` and `/proxy-image/` endpoint. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/frontis-blocks/tags/1.1.4/includes/Admin/Admin.php#L910<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/frontis-blocks/trunk/includes/Admin/Admin.php#L910<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3444616/<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/322e0a27-9119-4b46-a043-d3a68c4fcdc4?source=cve |
| 14 | CVE-2026-1257 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Administrative Shortcodes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 0.3.4 via the `slug` attribute of the `get_template` shortcode. This is due to insufficient path validation on user-supplied input passed to the get_template_part() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other "safe" file types can be uploaded and included. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/administrative-shortcodes/tags/0.3.4/administrative-shortcodes.php#L144<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/administrative-shortcodes/trunk/administrative-shortcodes.php#L144<br>[3]https://wordpress.org/plugins/administrative-shortcodes<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/119fe499-88c4-413f-a44a-2b3acfdbdeb5?source=cve |
| 15 | CVE-2026-0800 | 7.2  | HIGH | The User Submitted Posts – Enable Users to Submit Posts from the Front End plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the custom fields in all versions up to, and including, 20251210 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3436859/user-submitted-posts<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/1ec907bc-bd10-4dc5-be35-4f2aaf5ef444?source=cve |
| 16 | CVE-2026-0911 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Hustle – Email Marketing, Lead Generation, Optins, Popups plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to incorrect file type validation in the action_import_module() function in all versions up to, and including, 7.8.9.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with a lower-privileged role (e.g., Subscriber-level access and above), to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. Successful exploitation requires an admin to grant Hustle module permissions (or module edit access) to the low-privileged user so they can access the Hustle admin page and obtain the required nonce. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3440956/wordpress-popup<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/22be5fb5-143e-4934-9f93-e17def18e883?source=cve |
