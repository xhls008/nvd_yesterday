| 72 | CVE-2025-21622 | 7.5  | HIGH | ClipBucket V5 provides open source video hosting with PHP. During the user avatar upload workflow, a user can choose to upload and change their avatar at any time. During deletion, ClipBucket checks for the avatar_url as a filepath within the avatars subdirectory. If the URL path exists within the avatars directory, ClipBucket will delete it. There is no check for path traversal sequences in the provided user input (stored in the DB as avatar_url) therefore the final $file variable could be tainted with path traversal sequences. This leads to file deletion outside of the intended scope of the avatars folder. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.5.1 - 237. | [1]https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/commit/22329c4675e82c7c95e74024ba247f837ac9e00b<br>[2]https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/security/advisories/GHSA-5qpx-23rw-36gg<br>[3]https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/security/advisories/GHSA-5qpx-23rw-36gg |

Prior to 5.5.1 - 239, a file upload vulnerability exists in the Manage Playlist functionality of the application, specifically surrounding the uploading of playlist cover images. Without proper checks, an attacker can upload a PHP script file instead of an image file, thus allowing a webshell or other malicious files to be stored and executed on the server. This attack vector exists in both the admin area and low-level user area. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.5.1 - 239. | [1]https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/commit/893bfb0f1236c4a59b5e2843ab8d27a1e491b12b<br>[2]https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/security/advisories/GHSA-98vm-2xqm-xrcc<br>[3]https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/security/advisories/GHSA-98vm-2xqm-xrcc |

| 99 | CVE-2024-12430 | 7.0  | HIGH | An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could cause enable command execution. A vulnerability exists in the AC500 V3 version mentioned. After successfully exploiting CVE-2024-12429 (directory traversal), a successfully authenticated attacker can inject arbitrary commands into a specifically crafted file, which then will be executed by root user.All AC500 V3 products (PM5xxx) with firmware version earlier than 3.8.0 are affected by this vulnerability. | [1]https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=3ADR011377&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch |
| 100 | CVE-2024-55555 | 8.8  | HIGH | Invoice Ninja before 5.10.43 allows remote code execution from a pre-authenticated route when an attacker knows the APP_KEY. This is exacerbated by .env files, available from the product`s repository, that have default APP_KEY values. The route/{hash} route defined in the invoiceninja/routes/client.php file can be accessed without authentication. The parameter {hash} is passed to the function decrypt that expects a Laravel ciphered value containing a serialized object. (Furthermore, Laravel contains several gadget chains usable to trigger remote command execution from arbitrary deserialization.) Therefore, an attacker in possession of the APP_KEY is able to fully control a string passed to an unserialize function. | [1]https://github.com/invoiceninja/invoiceninja/commit/d9302021472c3e7e23bac8c3d5fbec57a5f38f0c<br>[2]https://www.synacktiv.com/advisories/invoiceninja-unauthenticated-remote-command-execution-when-appkey-known |
| 101 | CVE-2024-8361 | 7.5  | HIGH | In SiWx91x devices, the SHA2/224 algorithm returns a hash of 256 bits instead of 224 bits. This incorrect hash length triggers a software assertion, which subsequently causes a Denial of Service (DoS).If a watchdog is implemented, device will restart after watch dog expires.

| 106 | CVE-2025-22132 | 8.3  | HIGH | WeGIA is a web manager for charitable institutions. A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the file upload functionality of the WeGIA/html/socio/sistema/controller/controla_xlsx.php endpoint. By uploading a file containing malicious JavaScript code, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the context of a victim`s browser. This can lead to information theft, session hijacking, and other forms of client-side exploitation. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.2.7. | [1]https://github.com/nilsonLazarin/WeGIA/commit/330f641db43cfb0c8ea8bb6025cc0732de4d4d6b<br>[2]https://github.com/nilsonLazarin/WeGIA/security/advisories/GHSA-h8hr-jhcx-fcv9 |
| 107 | CVE-2025-22133 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | WeGIA is a web manager for charitable institutions. Prior to 3.2.8, a critical vulnerability was identified in the /WeGIA/html/socio/sistema/controller/controla_xlsx.php endpoint. The endpoint accepts file uploads without proper validation, allowing the upload of malicious files, such as .phar, which can then be executed by the server. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.2.8. | [1]https://github.com/nilsonLazarin/WeGIA/commit/a08f04de96d3caec85496d7a89a5b82d1960d9dd<br>[2]https://github.com/nilsonLazarin/WeGIA/security/advisories/GHSA-mjgr-2jxv-v8qf |
