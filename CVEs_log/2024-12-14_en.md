| 1 | CVE-2024-12212 | 7.8  | HIGH | The vulnerability occurs in the parsing of CSP files. The issues result from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which could allow reading past the end of allocated data structures, resulting in execution of arbitrary code. | [1]https://hornerautomation.com/cscape-software-free/cscape-software/<br>[2]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-345-05 |

| 3 | CVE-2024-21543 | 7.1  | HIGH | Versions of the package djoser before 2.3.0 are vulnerable to Authentication Bypass when the authenticate() function fails. This is because the system falls back to querying the database directly, granting access to users with valid credentials, and eventually bypassing custom authentication checks such as two-factor authentication, LDAP validations, or requirements from configured AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS. | [1]https://github.com/sunscrapers/djoser/commit/d33c3993c0c735f23cbedc60fa59fce69354f19d<br>[2]https://github.com/sunscrapers/djoser/issues/795<br>[3]https://github.com/sunscrapers/djoser/pull/819<br>[4]https://github.com/sunscrapers/djoser/releases/tag/2.3.0<br>[5]https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-DJOSER-8366540 |
| 4 | CVE-2024-10783 | 8.1  | HIGH | The MainWP Child – Securely Connects to the MainWP Dashboard to Manage Multiple Sites plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to a missing authorization checks on the register_site function in all versions up to, and including, 5.2 when a site is left in an unconfigured state. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as an administrator on instances where MainWP Child is not yet connected to the MainWP Dashboard. IMPORTANT: this only affects sites who have MainWP Child installed and have not yet connected to the MainWP Dashboard, and do not have the unique security ID feature enabled. Sites already connected to the MainWP Dashboard plugin and do not have the unique security ID feature enabled, are NOT affected and not required to upgrade. Please note 5.2.1 contains a partial patch, though we consider 5.3 to be the complete patch. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/mainwp-child/tags/5.2/class/class-mainwp-child.php#L76<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/mainwp-child/tags/5.2/class/class-mainwp-connect.php#L69<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/mainwp-child/tags/5.2/class/class-mainwp-connect.php#L788<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3197586%40mainwp-child&new=3197586%40mainwp-child&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[5]https://wordpress.org/plugins/mainwp-child/<br>[6]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/9156e536-a58e-4d78-b136-af8a9613ee23?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2024-9290 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Super Backup & Clone - Migrate for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation and a missing capability check on the ibk_restore_migrate_check() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.3.

| 6 | CVE-2024-21576 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | ComfyUI-Bmad-Nodes is vulnerable to Code Injection. The issue stems from a validation bypass in the BuildColorRangeHSVAdvanced, FilterContour and FindContour custom nodes. In the entrypoint function to each node, there’s a call to eval which can be triggered by generating a workflow that injects a crafted string into the node. This can result in executing arbitrary code on the server. | [1]https://github.com/bmad4ever/comfyui_bmad_nodes/blob/392af9490cbadf32a1fe92ff820ebabe88c51ee8/cv_nodes.py#L1814 |

| 80 | CVE-2024-55661 | 8.8  | HIGH | Laravel Pulse is a real-time application performance monitoring tool and dashboard for Laravel applications. A vulnerability has been discovered in Laravel Pulse prior to version 1.3.1 that could allow remote code execution through the public `remember()` method in the `Laravel\Pulse\Livewire\Concerns\RemembersQueries` trait. This method is accessible via Livewire components and can be exploited to call arbitrary callables within the application. An authenticated user with access to Laravel Pulse dashboard can execute arbitrary code by calling any function or static method in which the callable is a function or static method and the callable has no parameters or no strict parameter types. The vulnerable to component is `remember(callable $query, string $key = ``)` method in `Laravel\Pulse\Livewire\Concerns\RemembersQueries`, and the vulnerability affects all Pulse card components that use this trait. Version 1.3.1 contains a patch. | [1]https://github.com/laravel/pulse/commit/d1a5bf2eca36c6e3bedb4ceecd45df7d002a1ebc<br>[2]https://github.com/laravel/pulse/security/advisories/GHSA-8vwh-pr89-4mw2 |
| 81 | CVE-2024-55887 | 8.6  | HIGH | Ucum-java is a FHIR Java library providing UCUM Services. In versions prior to 1.0.9, XML parsing performed by the UcumEssenceService is vulnerable to XML external entity injections. A processed XML file with a malicious DTD tag could produce XML containing data from the host system. This impacts use cases where ucum is being used to within a host where external clients can submit XML. Release 1.0.9 of Ucum-java fixes this vulnerability. As a workaround, ensure that the source xml for instantiating UcumEssenceService is trusted. | [1]https://github.com/FHIR/Ucum-java/security/advisories/GHSA-w9j7-phm3-f97j |
