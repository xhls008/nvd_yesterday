|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2025-64109 | 8.8  | HIGH | Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions and below, a vulnerability in the Cursor CLI Beta allowed an attacker to achieve remote code execution through the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server mechanism by uploading a malicious MCP configuration in .cursor/mcp.json file in a GitHub repository. Once a victim clones the project and opens it using Cursor CLI, the command to run the malicious MCP server is immediately executed without any warning, leading to potential code execution as soon as the command runs. This issue is fixed in version 2025.09.17-25b418f. | [1]https://github.com/cursor/cursor/security/advisories/GHSA-4hwr-97q3-37w2 |
| 2 | CVE-2025-12735 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The expr-eval library is a JavaScript expression parser and evaluator designed to safely evaluate mathematical expressions with user-defined variables. However, due to insufficient input validation, an attacker can pass a crafted variables object into the evaluate() function and trigger arbitrary code execution. | [1]https://github.com/jorenbroekema/expr-eval<br>[2]https://github.com/silentmatt/expr-eval<br>[3]https://github.com/silentmatt/expr-eval/pull/288<br>[4]https://www.npmjs.com/package/expr-eval<br>[5]https://www.npmjs.com/package/expr-eval-fork |
| 3 | CVE-2025-12197 | 7.5  | HIGH | The The Events Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to blind SQL Injection via the `s` parameter in versions 6.15.1.1 to 6.15.9 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3386042/the-events-calendar<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/bc927a93-0cb2-4211-9f93-c0671039011e?source=cve |

| 8 | CVE-2025-12384 | 8.6  | HIGH | The Document Embedder – Embed PDFs, Word, Excel, and Other Files plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access/modification/loss of data in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.0. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action in the "bplde_save_document_library", "bplde_get_all", "bplde_get_single", and "bplde_delete_document_library" functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create, read, update, and delete arbitrary document_library posts. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?old=3359820&old_path=document-emberdder%2Ftrunk%2Fdocument-library-block.php&new=&new_path=document-emberdder%2Ftrunk%2Fdocument-library-block.php<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?old=3359820&old_path=document-emberdder%2Ftrunk%2Fincludes%2FDocumentLibrary%2FInit-DocumentLibrary.php&new=&new_path=document-emberdder%2Ftrunk%2Fincludes%2FDocumentLibrary%2FInit-DocumentLibrary.php<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/eb7e4e96-a4ff-4c6c-91de-c0e5ba78f0da?source=cve |
