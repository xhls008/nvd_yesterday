| 1 | CVE-2024-6152 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Flipbox Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.5 via deserialization of untrusted input in the flipbox_builder_Flipbox_ShortCode function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/flipbox-builder/trunk/template-front/shortcode.php#L30<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0e9cd38a-b2cd-4801-a06b-4e965fa72e04?source=cve |
