|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2025-13329 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The File Uploader for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the callback function for the `add-image-data` REST API endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files to the Uploadcare service and subsequently download them on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://wordpress.org/plugins/file-uploader-for-woocommerce/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/da0f0e1a-bbf8-42a5-b330-b53134488ebd?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2025-13619 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Flex Store Users plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0. This is due to the `fsUserHandle::signup` and the `fsSellerRole::add_role_seller` functions not restricting what user roles a user can register with. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to supply the `administrator` role during registration and gain administrator access to the site. Note: The vulnerability can be exploited with the `fs_type` parameter if the Flex Store Seller plugin is also activated. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/autosmart-automotive-car-dealer-wordpress-theme/20322930<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/a2fc40ed-a6af-4069-be63-cb75e98cc98a?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2025-7782 | 7.6  | HIGH | The WP JobHunt plugin for WordPress, used by the JobCareer theme, is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the `cs_update_application_status_callback` function in all versions up to, and including, 7.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Candidate-level access and above, to inject cross-site scripting into the `status` parameter of applied jobs for any user. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/jobcareer-job-board-responsive-wordpress-theme/14221636<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/af063570-43f7-4bf4-850c-21c3bff40ac1?source=cve |
