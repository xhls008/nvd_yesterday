YourSpotify versions < 1.9.0 do not protect the API and login flow against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Attackers can use this to execute CSRF attacks on victims, allowing them to retrieve, modify or delete data on the affected YourSpotify instance.

| 36 | CVE-2024-28194 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | your_spotify is an open source, self hosted Spotify tracking dashboard. YourSpotify versions < 1.8.0 use a hardcoded JSON Web Token (JWT) secret to sign authentication tokens. Attackers can use this well-known value to forge valid authentication tokens for arbitrary users. This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication and authenticate as arbitrary YourSpotify users, including admin users. This issue has been addressed in version 1.8.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/Yooooomi/your_spotify/security/advisories/GHSA-gvcr-g265-j827 |

| 38 | CVE-2024-22167 | 7.9  | HIGH | A potential DLL hijacking vulnerability in the SanDisk PrivateAccess application for Windows that could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the system user. This vulnerability is only exploitable locally if an attacker has access to a copy of the user`s vault or has already gained access into a user`s system. This attack is limited to the system in context and cannot be propagated. | [1]https://www.westerndigital.com/support/product-security/wdc-24002-sandisk-privateaccess-desktop-app-v-6-4-10 |
| 39 | CVE-2024-27102 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | Wings is the server control plane for Pterodactyl Panel. This vulnerability impacts anyone running the affected versions of Wings. The vulnerability can potentially be used to access files and directories on the host system. The full scope of impact is exactly unknown, but reading files outside of a server`s base directory (sandbox root) is possible. In order to use this exploit, an attacker must have an existing "server" allocated and controlled by Wings. Details on the exploitation of this vulnerability are embargoed until March 27th, 2024 at 18:00 UTC. In order to mitigate this vulnerability, a full rewrite of the entire server filesystem was necessary. Because of this, the size of the patch is massive, however effort was made to reduce the amount of breaking changes. Users are advised to update to version 1.11.9. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/commit/d1c0ca526007113a0f74f56eba99511b4e989287<br>[2]https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/security/advisories/GHSA-494h-9924-xww9 |
| 40 | CVE-2024-28175 | 9.0  | CRITICAL | Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Due to the improper URL protocols filtering of links specified in the `link.argocd.argoproj.io` annotations in the application summary component, an attacker can achieve cross-site scripting with elevated permissions. All unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with v1.0.0 are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug allowing a malicious user to inject a javascript: link in the UI. When clicked by a victim user, the script will execute with the victim`s permissions (up to and including admin). This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim via the API, such as creating, modifying, and deleting Kubernetes resources. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions v2.10.3 v2.9.8, and v2.8.12. There are no completely-safe workarounds besides upgrading. The safest alternative, if upgrading is not possible, would be to create a Kubernetes admission controller to reject any resources with an annotation starting with link.argocd.argoproj.io or reject the resource if the value use an improper URL protocol. This validation will need to be applied in all clusters managed by ArgoCD. | [1]https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/479b5544b57dc9ef767d49f7003f39602c480b71<br>[2]https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-jwv5-8mqv-g387 |
