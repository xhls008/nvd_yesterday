| 1 | CVE-2025-55319 | 8.8  | HIGH | Ai command injection in Agentic AI and Visual Studio Code allows an unauthorized attacker to execute code over a network. | [1]https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-55319 |
| 2 | CVE-2025-58754 | 7.5  | HIGH | Axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. When Axios prior to version 1.11.0 runs on Node.js and is given a URL with the `data:` scheme, it does not perform HTTP. Instead, its Node http adapter decodes the entire payload into memory (`Buffer`/`Blob`) and returns a synthetic 200 response. This path ignores `maxContentLength` / `maxBodyLength` (which only protect HTTP responses), so an attacker can supply a very large `data:` URI and cause the process to allocate unbounded memory and crash (DoS), even if the caller requested `responseType: `stream``. Version 1.11.0 contains a patch for the issue. | [1]https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/945435fc51467303768202250debb8d4ae892593<br>[2]https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/7011<br>[3]https://github.com/axios/axios/releases/tag/v1.12.0<br>[4]https://github.com/axios/axios/security/advisories/GHSA-4hjh-wcwx-xvwj<br>[5]https://github.com/axios/axios/security/advisories/GHSA-4hjh-wcwx-xvwj |
| 3 | CVE-2025-9807 | 7.5  | HIGH | The The Events Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the ‘s’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 6.15.1 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/the-events-calendar/tags/6.15.0.1/src/Events/Custom_Tables/V1/WP_Query/Custom_Tables_Query.php#L682<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/8ea2ce90-6c8c-4a31-8faa-4ab99879d8b8?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2025-10269 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Spirit Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.13. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary .php files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where .php file types can be uploaded and included. | [1]https://patchstack.com/database/wordpress/plugin/spirit-framework/vulnerability/wordpress-spirit-framework-plugin-1-2-13-local-file-inclusion-vulnerability<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/38391221-c435-4672-809a-ebabf639c9bb?source=cve |

| 7 | CVE-2025-8575 | 7.2  | HIGH | The LWS Cleaner plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the `lws_cl_delete_file` function in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.1.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/lws-cleaner/trunk/lws-cleaner.php#L1144<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3359598/<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/fa37025a-7f20-4cfe-a7d0-38168f49b6d9?source=cve |
| 8 | CVE-2025-9086 | 7.5  | HIGH | 1. A cookie is set using the `secure` keyword for `https://target`2. curl is redirected to or otherwise made to speak with `http://target` (same   hostname, but using clear text HTTP) using the same cookie set3. The same cookie name is set - but with just a slash as path (`path=`/``).   Since this site is not secure, the cookie *should* just be ignored.4. A bug in the path comparison logic makes curl read outside a heap buffer   boundaryThe bug either causes a crash or it potentially makes the comparison come tothe wrong conclusion and lets the clear-text site override the contents of thesecure cookie, contrary to expectations and depending on the memory contentsimmediately following the single-byte allocation that holds the path.The presumed and correct behavior would be to plainly ignore the second set ofthe cookie since it was already set as secure on a secure host so overridingit on an insecure host should not be okay. | [1]https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2025-9086.html<br>[2]https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2025-9086.json<br>[3]https://hackerone.com/reports/3294999 |

| 18 | CVE-2024-45432 | 7.5  | HIGH | OpenSynergy BlueSDK (aka Blue SDK) through 6.x mishandles a function call. The specific flaw exists within the BlueSDK Bluetooth stack. The issue results from an incorrect variable used as a function argument. An attacker can leverage this to cause unexpected behavior or obtain sensitive information. | [1]https://pcacybersecurity.com/resources/advisory/perfekt-blue<br>[2]https://www.opensynergy.com/ |
| 19 | CVE-2024-45434 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | OpenSynergy BlueSDK (aka Blue SDK) through 6.x has a Use-After-Free. The specific flaw exists within the BlueSDK Bluetooth stack.

An attacker can leverage this to achieve remote code execution in the context of a user account under which the Bluetooth process runs. | [1]https://pcacybersecurity.com/resources/advisory/perfekt-blue<br>[2]https://www.opensynergy.com/<br>[3]https://pcacybersecurity.com/resources/advisory/perfekt-blue |
| 20 | CVE-2025-58434 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Flowise is a drag & drop user interface to build a customized large language model flow. In version 3.0.5 and earlier, the `forgot-password` endpoint in Flowise returns sensitive information including a valid password reset `tempToken` without authentication or verification. This enables any attacker to generate a reset token for arbitrary users and directly reset their password, leading to a complete account takeover (ATO). This vulnerability applies to both the cloud service (`cloud.flowiseai.com`) and self-hosted/local Flowise deployments that expose the same API. Commit 9e178d68873eb876073846433a596590d3d9c863 secures password reset endpoints. Several recommended remediation steps are available. Do not return reset tokens or sensitive account details in API responses. Tokens must only be delivered securely via the registered email channel. Ensure `forgot-password` responds with a generic success message regardless of input, to avoid user enumeration. Require strong validation of the `tempToken` (e.g., single-use, short expiry, tied to request origin, validated against email delivery). Apply the same fixes to both cloud and self-hosted/local deployments. Log and monitor password reset requests for suspicious activity. Consider multi-factor verification for sensitive accounts. | [1]https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/commit/9e178d68873eb876073846433a596590d3d9c863<br>[2]https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/security/advisories/GHSA-wgpv-6j63-x5ph |
