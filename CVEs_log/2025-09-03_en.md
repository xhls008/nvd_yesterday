| 1 | CVE-2025-57808 | 8.1  | HIGH | ESPHome is a system to control microcontrollers remotely through Home Automation systems. In version 2025.8.0 in the ESP-IDF platform, ESPHome`s web_server authentication check can pass incorrectly when the client-supplied base64-encoded Authorization value is empty or is a substring of the correct value. This allows access to web_server functionality (including OTA, if enabled) without knowing any information about the correct username or password. This issue has been patched in version 2025.8.1. | [1]https://github.com/esphome/esphome/commit/2aceb56606ec8afec5f49c92e140c8050a6ccbe5<br>[2]https://github.com/esphome/esphome/security/advisories/GHSA-mxh2-ccgj-8635<br>[3]https://github.com/esphome/esphome/security/advisories/GHSA-mxh2-ccgj-8635 |
