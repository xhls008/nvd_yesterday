| 12 | CVE-2024-45496 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | A flaw was found in OpenShift. This issue occurs due to the misuse of elevated privileges in the OpenShift Container Platform`s build process. During the build initialization step, the git-clone container is run with a privileged security context, allowing unrestricted access to the node. An attacker with developer-level access can provide a crafted .gitconfig file containing commands executed during the cloning process, leading to arbitrary command execution on the worker node. An attacker running code in a privileged container could escalate their permissions on the node running the container. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-45496<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2308661 |
| 13 | CVE-2024-7387 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | A flaw was found in openshift/builder.

When using the “Docker” strategy, executable files inside the privileged build container can be overridden using the `spec.source.secrets.secret.destinationDir` attribute of the `BuildConfig` definition. An attacker running code in a privileged container could escalate their permissions on the node running the container. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-7387<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2302259 |

| 38 | CVE-2024-45606 | 7.1  | HIGH | Sentry is a developer-first error tracking and performance monitoring platform. An authenticated user can mute alert rules from arbitrary organizations and projects with a know rule ID. The user does not need to be a member of the organization or have permissions on the project.  In our review, we have identified no instances where alerts have been muted by unauthorized parties.  A patch was issued to ensure authorization checks are properly scoped on requests to mute alert rules. Authenticated users who do not have the necessary permissions are no longer able to mute alerts.  Sentry SaaS users do not need to take any action. Self-Hosted Sentry users should upgrade to version **24.9.0** or higher. The rule mute feature was generally available as of 23.6.0 but users with early access may have had the feature as of 23.4.0. Affected users are advised to upgrade to version 24.9.0. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted<br>[2]https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/77016<br>[3]https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/security/advisories/GHSA-v345-w9f2-mpm5 |

| 41 | CVE-2024-46982 | 7.5  | HIGH | Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. By sending a crafted HTTP request, it is possible to poison the cache of a non-dynamic server-side rendered route in the pages router (this does not affect the app router). When this crafted request is sent it could coerce Next.js to cache a route that is meant to not be cached and send a `Cache-Control: s-maxage=1, stale-while-revalidate` header which some upstream CDNs may cache as well. To be potentially affected all of the following must apply: 1. Next.js between 13.5.1 and 14.2.9, 2. Using pages router, & 3. Using non-dynamic server-side rendered routes e.g. `pages/dashboard.tsx` not `pages/blog/[slug].tsx`. This vulnerability was resolved in Next.js v13.5.7, v14.2.10, and later. We recommend upgrading regardless of whether you can reproduce the issue or not. There are no official or recommended workarounds for this issue, we recommend that users patch to a safe version. | [1]https://github.com/vercel/next.js/commit/7ed7f125e07ef0517a331009ed7e32691ba403d3<br>[2]https://github.com/vercel/next.js/commit/bd164d53af259c05f1ab434004bcfdd3837d7cda<br>[3]https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-gp8f-8m3g-qvj9 |
