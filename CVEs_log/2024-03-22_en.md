| 12 | CVE-2023-41038 | 7.5  | HIGH | Firebird is a relational database. Versions 4.0.0 through 4.0.3 and version 5.0 beta1 are vulnerable to a server crash when a user uses a specific form of SET BIND statement. Any non-privileged user with minimum access to a server may type a statement with a long `CHAR` length, which causes the server to crash due to stack corruption. Versions 4.0.4.2981 and 5.0.0.117 contain fixes for this issue.

| 13 | CVE-2023-41877 | 7.2  | HIGH | GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. A path traversal vulnerability in versions 2.23.4 and prior requires GeoServer Administrator with access to the admin console to misconfigure the Global Settings for log file location to an arbitrary location. The admin console GeoServer Logs page provides a preview of these contents. As this issue requires GeoServer administrators access, often representing a trusted party, the vulnerability has not received a patch as of time of publication. As a workaround, a system administrator responsible for running GeoServer can use the `GEOSERVER_LOG_FILE` setting to override any configuration option provided by the Global Settings page. The `GEOSERVER_LOG_LOCATION` parameter can be set as system property, environment variables, or servlet context parameters. | [1]https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/configuration/globalsettings.html#log-location<br>[2]https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/security/advisories/GHSA-8g7v-vjrc-x4g5 |
| 14 | CVE-2023-51444 | 7.2  | HIGH | GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. An arbitrary file upload vulnerability exists in versions prior to 2.23.4 and 2.24.1 that enables an authenticated administrator with permissions to modify coverage stores through the REST Coverage Store API to upload arbitrary file contents to arbitrary file locations which can lead to remote code execution. Coverage stores that are configured using relative paths use a GeoServer Resource implementation that has validation to prevent path traversal but coverage stores that are configured using absolute paths use a different Resource implementation that does not prevent path traversal. This vulnerability can lead to executing arbitrary code. An administrator with limited privileges could also potentially exploit this to overwrite GeoServer security files and obtain full administrator privileges. Versions 2.23.4 and 2.24.1 contain a fix for this issue. | [1]https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/commit/ca683170c669718cb6ad4c79e01b0451065e13b8<br>[2]https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/commit/fe235b3bb1d7f05751a4a2ef5390c36f5c9e78ae<br>[3]https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/pull/7222<br>[4]https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/security/advisories/GHSA-9v5q-2gwq-q9hq<br>[5]https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-11176 |

| 23 | CVE-2024-28179 | 9.0  | CRITICAL | Jupyter Server Proxy allows users to run arbitrary external processes alongside their Jupyter notebook servers and provides authenticated web access. Prior to versions 3.2.3 and 4.1.1, Jupyter Server Proxy did not check user authentication appropriately when proxying websockets, allowing unauthenticated access to anyone who had network access to the Jupyter server endpoint. This vulnerability can allow unauthenticated remote access to any websocket endpoint set up to be accessible via Jupyter Server Proxy. In many cases, this leads to remote unauthenticated arbitrary code execution, due to how affected instances use websockets. The websocket endpoints exposed by `jupyter_server` itself is not affected. Projects that do not rely on websockets are also not affected. Versions 3.2.3 and 4.1.1 contain a fix for this issue. | [1]https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy/blob/9b624c4d9507176334b46a85d94a4aa3bcd29bed/jupyter_server_proxy/handlers.py#L433<br>[2]https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy/commit/764e499f61a87641916a7a427d4c4b1ac3f321a9<br>[3]https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy/commit/bead903b7c0354b6efd8b4cde94b89afab653e03<br>[4]https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-w3vc-fx9p-wp4v |
| 24 | CVE-2024-28231 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | eprosima Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the Data Distribution Service standard of the Object Management Group. Prior to versions 2.14.0, 2.13.4, 2.12.3, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8, manipulated DATA Submessage can cause a heap overflow error in the Fast-DDS process, causing the process to be terminated remotely. Additionally, the payload_size in the DATA Submessage packet is declared as uint32_t. When a negative number, such as -1, is input into this variable, it results in an Integer Overflow (for example, -1 gets converted to 0xFFFFFFFF). This eventually leads to a heap-buffer-overflow, causing the program to terminate. Versions 2.14.0, 2.13.4, 2.12.3, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8 contain a fix for this issue. | [1]https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/commit/355706386f4af9ce74125eeec3c449b06113112b<br>[2]https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/security/advisories/GHSA-9m2j-qw67-ph4w |
| 25 | CVE-2024-29033 | 7.5  | HIGH | OAuthenticator provides plugins for JupyterHub to use common OAuth providers, as well as base classes for writing one`s own Authenticators with any OAuth 2.0 provider. `GoogleOAuthenticator.hosted_domain` is used to restrict what Google accounts can be authorized access to a JupyterHub. The restriction is intented to be to Google accounts part of one or more Google organization verified to control specified domain(s). Prior to version 16.3.0, the actual restriction has been to Google accounts with emails ending with the domain. Such accounts could have been created by anyone which at one time was able to read an email associated with the domain. This was described by Dylan Ayrey (@dxa4481) in this [blog post] from 15th December 2023). OAuthenticator 16.3.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, restrict who can login another way, such as `allowed_users` or `allowed_google_groups`. | [1]https://github.com/jupyterhub/oauthenticator/commit/5246b09675501b09fb6ed64022099b7644812f60<br>[2]https://github.com/jupyterhub/oauthenticator/security/advisories/GHSA-55m3-44xf-hg4h<br>[3]https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/google-oauth-is-broken-sort-of |
| 26 | CVE-2024-29037 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | datahub-helm provides the Kubernetes Helm charts for deploying Datahub and its dependencies on a Kubernetes cluster. Starting in version 0.1.143 and prior to version 0.2.182, due to configuration issues in the helm chart, if there was a successful initial deployment during a limited window of time, personal access tokens were possibly created with a default secret key. Since the secret key is a static, publicly available value, someone could inspect the algorithm used to generate personal access tokens and generate their own for an instance. Deploying with Metadata Service Authentication enabled would have been difficult during window of releases. If someone circumvented the helm settings and manually set Metadata Service Authentication to be enabled using environment variables directly, this would skip over the autogeneration logic for the Kubernetes Secrets and DataHub GMS would default to the signing key specified statically in the application.yml. Most deployments probably did not attempt to circumvent the helm settings to enable Metadata Service Authentication during this time, so impact is most likely limited. Any deployments with Metadata Service Authentication enabled should ensure that their secret values are properly randomized. Version 0.2.182 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, one may reset the token signing key to be a random value, which will invalidate active personal access tokens. | [1]https://github.com/acryldata/datahub-helm/commit/ea8a17860f053c63387b8309e1f77c0e1462a1b3<br>[2]https://github.com/acryldata/datahub-helm/security/advisories/GHSA-82p6-9h7m-9h8j |
