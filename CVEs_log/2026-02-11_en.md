| 1 | CVE-2025-15310 | 7.8  | HIGH | Tanium addressed a local privilege escalation vulnerability in Patch Endpoint Tools. | [1]https://security.tanium.com/TAN-2025-001 |
| 2 | CVE-2026-0845 | 7.2  | HIGH | The WCFM – Frontend Manager for WooCommerce along with Bookings Subscription Listings Compatible plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the `WCFM_Settings_Controller::processing` function in all versions up to, and including, 6.7.24. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Shop Manager-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wc-frontend-manager/tags/6.7.24/controllers/settings/wcfm-controller-settings.php#L150<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wc-frontend-manager/tags/6.7.24/core/class-wcfm-ajax.php#L285<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3455819/wc-frontend-manager/trunk/controllers/settings/wcfm-controller-settings.php<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/4973cef3-dddf-4eb5-99f4-c23a0e162fd6?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2026-0485 | 7.5  | HIGH | SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform allows an unauthenticated attacker to send specially crafted requests that could cause the Content Management Server (CMS) to crash and automatically restart.

| 21 | CVE-2026-1866 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Name Directory plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via double HTML-entity encoding in all versions up to, and including, 1.32.0. This is due to the plugin`s sanitization function calling `html_entity_decode()` before `wp_kses()`, and then calling `html_entity_decode()` again on output. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page via the `name_directory_name` and `name_directory_description` parameters in the public submission form granted they can trick the site administrator into approving their submission or auto-publish is enabled. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/name-directory/tags/1.31.0/helpers.php#L604<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/name-directory/tags/1.31.0/shortcode.php#L193<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/name-directory/tags/1.31.0/shortcode.php#L41<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3455023/name-directory/trunk?contextall=1&old=3446566&old_path=%2Fname-directory%2Ftrunk#file3<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/29d13457-ac60-4e3d-9d8b-0141e6f8f4f6?source=cve |

| 29 | CVE-2026-23906 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Affected Products and Versions  *  Apache Druid  *  Affected Versions: 0.17.0 through 35.x (all versions prior to 36.0.0)  *  Prerequisites:  *  druid-basic-security extension enabled  *  LDAP authenticator configured  *  Underlying LDAP server permits anonymous bind                                                                                                                                                   Vulnerability DescriptionAn authentication bypass vulnerability exists in Apache Druid when using the druid-basic-security extension with LDAP authentication. If the underlying LDAP server is configured to allow anonymousbinds, an attacker can bypass authentication by providing an existing username with an empty password. This allows unauthorized access to otherwise restricted Druid resources without valid credentials.The vulnerability stems from improper validation of LDAP authentication responses when anonymous binds are permitted, effectively treating anonymous bind success as valid user authentication. ImpactA remote, unauthenticated attacker can:  *  Gain unauthorized access to the Apache Druid cluster  *  Access sensitive data stored in Druid datasources  *  Execute queries and potentially manipulate data  *  Access administrative interfaces if the bypassed account has elevated privileges  *  Completely compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Druid deployment                                                                                                                                                                                    Mitigation Immediate Mitigation (No Druid Upgrade Required):                                                                                                                                                      *  Disable anonymous bind on your LDAP server. This prevents the vulnerability from being exploitable and is the recommended immediate action.Resolution  *  Upgrade Apache Druid to version 36.0.0 or later, which includes fixes to properly reject anonymous LDAP bind attempts. | [1]https://lists.apache.org/thread/2x9rv3kv6t1p577lvq4z0rl0zlt9g4sr |

| 31 | CVE-2026-2268 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Ninja Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 3.14.0. This is due to the unsafe application of the `ninja_forms_merge_tags` filter to user-supplied input within repeater fields, which allows the resolution of `{post_meta:KEY}` merge tags without authorization checks. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract arbitrary post metadata from any post on the site, including sensitive data such as WooCommerce billing emails, API keys, private tokens, and customer personal information via the `nf_ajax_submit` AJAX action. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ninja-forms/tags/3.13.3/includes/AJAX/Controllers/Submission.php#L222<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ninja-forms/tags/3.13.3/includes/AJAX/Controllers/Submission.php#L706<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ninja-forms/tags/3.13.3/includes/MergeTags/WP.php#L48<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3454719/ninja-forms/trunk/includes/AJAX/Controllers/Submission.php<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/24902fab-44ea-44c9-bcf5-70960cfeb402?source=cve |

| 120 | CVE-2026-25506 | 7.7  | HIGH | MUNGE is an authentication service for creating and validating user credentials. From 0.5 to 0.5.17, local attacker can exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in munged (the MUNGE authentication daemon) to leak cryptographic key material from process memory. With the leaked key material, the attacker could forge arbitrary MUNGE credentials to impersonate any user (including root) to services that rely on MUNGE for authentication. The vulnerability allows a buffer overflow by sending a crafted message with an oversized address length field, corrupting munged`s internal state and enabling extraction of the MAC subkey used for credential verification. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.5.18. | [1]https://github.com/dun/munge/commit/bf40cc27c4ce8451d4b062c9de0b67ec40894812<br>[2]https://github.com/dun/munge/releases/tag/munge-0.5.18<br>[3]https://github.com/dun/munge/security/advisories/GHSA-r9cr-jf4v-75gh<br>[4]http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2026/02/10/3<br>[5]https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2026/02/msg00015.html |
| 121 | CVE-2026-26009 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | Catalyst is a platform built for enterprise game server hosts, game communities, and billing panel integrations. Install scripts defined in server templates execute directly on the host operating system as root via bash -c, with no sandboxing or containerization.
