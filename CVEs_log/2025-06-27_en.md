| 1 | CVE-2024-6174 | 8.8  | HIGH | When a non-x86 platform is detected, cloud-init grants root access to a hardcoded url with a local IP address. To prevent this, cloud-init default configurations disable platform enumeration. | [1]https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/releases/tag/25.1.3 |
| 2 | CVE-2025-6212 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Ultra Addons for Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Database module in versions 3.5.11 to 3.5.19 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. The unfiltered field names are stored alongside the sanitized values. Later, the admin-side AJAX endpoint ajax_get_table_data() returns those raw names as JSON column headers, and the client-side DataTables renderer injects them directly into the DOM without any HTML encoding. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ultimate-addons-for-contact-form-7/trunk/addons/database/assets/js/database-pro-main.js<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ultimate-addons-for-contact-form-7/trunk/addons/database/database.php<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3316177/<br>[4]https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-addons-for-contact-form-7/#developers<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/f49e48cb-7d0b-4bcf-9090-869472b8442a?source=cve |

| 15 | CVE-2025-53002 | 8.3  | HIGH | LLaMA-Factory is a tuning library for large language models. A remote code execution vulnerability was discovered in LLaMA-Factory versions up to and including 0.9.3 during the LLaMA-Factory training process. This vulnerability arises because the `vhead_file` is loaded without proper safeguards, allowing malicious attackers to execute arbitrary malicious code on the host system simply by passing a malicious `Checkpoint path` parameter through the `WebUI` interface. The attack is stealthy, as the victim remains unaware of the exploitation. The root cause is that the `vhead_file` argument is loaded without the secure parameter `weights_only=True`. Version 0.9.4 contains a fix for the issue. | [1]https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AddKm2mllsXfuvL4Tvbn_WJdjEOYXx4y/view?usp=sharing<br>[2]https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/commit/bb7bf51554d4ba8432333c35a5e3b52705955ede<br>[3]https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/security/advisories/GHSA-xj56-p8mm-qmxj |

| 17 | CVE-2025-30131 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | An issue was discovered on IROAD Dashcam FX2 devices. An unauthenticated file upload endpoint can be leveraged to execute arbitrary commands by uploading a CGI-based webshell. Once a file is uploaded, the attacker can execute commands with root privileges, gaining full control over the dashcam. Additionally, by uploading a netcat (nc) binary, the attacker can establish a reverse shell, maintaining persistent remote and privileged access to the device. This allows complete device takeover. | [1]https://github.com/geo-chen/IROAD?tab=readme-ov-file#finding-11---cve-2025-30131-unrestricted-webshell<br>[2]https://www.iroadau.com.au/downloads/ |

| 20 | CVE-2025-52903 | 8.0  | HIGH | File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. In version 2.32.0, the Command Execution feature of File Browser only allows the execution of shell command which have been predefined on a user-specific allowlist. Many tools allow the execution of arbitrary different commands, rendering this limitation void. The concrete impact depends on the commands being granted to the attacker, but the large number of standard commands allowing the execution of subcommands makes it likely that every user having the `Execute commands` permissions can exploit this vulnerability. Everyone who can exploit it will have full code execution rights with the uid of the server process. Until this issue is fixed, the maintainers recommend to completely disable `Execute commands` for all accounts. Since the command execution is an inherently dangerous feature that is not used by all deployments, it should be possible to completely disable it in the application`s configuration. As a defense-in-depth measure, organizations not requiring command execution should operate the Filebrowser from a distroless container image. A patch version has been pushed to disable the feature for all existent installations, and making it opt-in. A warning has been added to the documentation and is printed on the console if the feature is enabled. Due to the project being in maintenance-only mode, the bug has not been fixed. The fix is tracked on pull request 5199. | [1]https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless<br>[2]https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/issues/5199<br>[3]https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/security/advisories/GHSA-3q2w-42mv-cph4<br>[4]https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/util-linux/prlimit.1.en.html<br>[5]https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/security/advisories/GHSA-3q2w-42mv-cph4 |
| 21 | CVE-2025-52904 | 8.0  | HIGH | File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. In version 2.32.0 of the web application, all users have a scope assigned, and they only have access to the files within that scope. The Command Execution feature of Filebrowser allows the execution of shell commands which are not restricted to the scope, potentially giving an attacker read and write access to all files managed by the server.
