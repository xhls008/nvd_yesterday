| 1 | CVE-2025-54588 | 7.5  | HIGH | Envoy is an open source L7 proxy and communication bus designed for large modern service oriented architectures. Versions 1.34.0 through 1.34.4 and 1.35.0 contain a use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability in the DNS cache, causing abnormal process termination. The vulnerability is in Envoy`s Dynamic Forward Proxy implementation, occurring when a completion callback for a DNS resolution triggers new DNS resolutions or removes existing pending resolutions. This condition may occur when the following conditions are met: dynamic Forwarding Filter is enabled, the `envoy.reloadable_features.dfp_cluster_resolves_hosts` runtime flag is enabled, and the Host header is modified between the Dynamic Forwarding Filter and Router filters. This issue is resolved in versions 1.34.5 and 1.35.1. To work around this issue, set the envoy.reloadable_features.dfp_cluster_resolves_hosts runtime flag to false. | [1]https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/releases/tag/v1.34.5<br>[2]https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/releases/tag/v1.35.1<br>[3]https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-g9vw-6pvx-7gmw |
| 2 | CVE-2025-9848 | 7.3  | HIGH | A security vulnerability has been detected in ScriptAndTools Real Estate Management System 1.0.

The exploit has been disclosed publicly and may be used. | [1]https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.322197<br>[2]https://vuldb.com/?id.322197<br>[3]https://vuldb.com/?submit.641980<br>[4]https://www.websecurityinsights.my.id/2025/08/real-estate-management-system-v-10-user.html |
| 3 | CVE-2025-58176 | 8.8  | HIGH | Dive is an open-source MCP Host Desktop Application that enables integration with function-calling LLMs. In versions 0.9.0 through 0.9.3, there is a one-click Remote Code Execution vulnerability triggered through a custom url value, `transport` in the JSON object. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability in the following two scenarios: a victim visits a malicious website controlled by the attacker and the website redirect to the URL automatically, or a victim clicks on such a crafted link embedded on a legitimate website (e.g., in user-generated content). In both cases, the browser invokes Dive`s custom URL handler (dive:), which launches the Dive app and processes the crafted URL, leading to arbitrary code execution on the victim’s machine. This vulnerability is caused by improper processing of custom url. This is fixed in version 0.9.4. | [1]https://github.com/OpenAgentPlatform/Dive/commit/acae6d40354d380f69f8241e9122a43ff64cff11<br>[2]https://github.com/OpenAgentPlatform/Dive/security/advisories/GHSA-2r34-7pgx-vvrc<br>[3]https://github.com/OpenAgentPlatform/Dive/security/advisories/GHSA-2r34-7pgx-vvrc |

| 10 | CVE-2014-125127 | 7.5  | HIGH | The mikecao/flight PHP framework in versions prior to v1.2 is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks due to eager loading of request bodies in the Request class constructor. The framework automatically reads the entire request body on every HTTP request, regardless of whether the application needs it. An attacker can exploit this by sending requests with large payloads, causing excessive memory consumption and potentially exhausting available server memory, leading to application crashes or service unavailability. The vulnerability was fixed in v1.2 by implementing lazy loading of request bodies. | [1]https://github.com/Checkmarx/Vulnerabilities-Proofs-of-Concept/tree/main/2014/CVE-2014-125127<br>[2]https://github.com/mikecao/flight/commit/da40e03eb4a39745107912dffe926a8fce0d38dc<br>[3]https://github.com/mikecao/flight/pull/125<br>[4]https://github.com/Checkmarx/Vulnerabilities-Proofs-of-Concept/tree/main/2014/CVE-2014-125127 |

| 39 | CVE-2025-52494 | 7.5  | HIGH | Adacore Ada Web Server (AWS) before 25.2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to improper handling of SSL handshakes during connection initialization. When a client initiates an HTTPS connection, the server performs the SSL handshake before assigning the connection to a processing slot. However, there is no specific timeout set for this phase, and the server uses the default socket timeout, which is effectively infinite. An attacker can exploit this by sending a malformed TLS ClientHello message with incorrect length values. This causes the server to wait indefinitely for data that never arrives, blocking the worker thread (Line) handling the connection. By opening multiple such connections, up to the server`s maximum limit, the attacker can exhaust all available working threads, preventing the server from handling new, legitimate requests. | [1]https://adacore.com<br>[2]https://docs.adacore.com/corp/security-advisories/SEC.AWS-0095-v1.pdf |
