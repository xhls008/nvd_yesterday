| 1 | CVE-2024-10125 | 7.5  | HIGH | The  Amazon.ApplicationLoadBalancer.Identity.AspNetCore repo https://github.com/awslabs/aws-alb-identity-aspnetcore#validatetokensignature  contains Middleware that can be used in conjunction with the Application Load Balancer (ALB) OpenId Connect integration and can be used in any  ASP.NET http://asp.net/  Core deployment scenario, including Fargate, EKS, ECS, EC2, and Lambda. In the JWT handling code, it performs signature validation but fails to validate the JWT issuer and signer identity. The signer omission, if combined with a scenario where the infrastructure owner allows internet traffic to the ALB targets (not a recommended configuration), can allow for JWT signing by an untrusted entity and an actor may be able to mimic valid OIDC-federated sessions to the ALB targets. | [1]https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2024-012/<br>[2]https://github.com/awslabs/aws-alb-identity-aspnetcore/security/advisories/GHSA-5gh5-cc5m-q244 |
| 2 | CVE-2024-8901 | 7.5  | HIGH | The  AWS ALB Route Directive Adapter For Istio repo https://github.com/awslabs/aws-alb-route-directive-adapter-for-istio/tree/master  provides an OIDC authentication mechanism that was integrated into the open source Kubeflow project. The adapter uses JWT for authentication, but lacks proper signer and issuer validation. In uncommon deployments of ALB, wherein endpoints are exposed to internet traffic, an actor can provide a JWT signed by an untrusted entity in order to spoof OIDC-federated sessions and successfully bypass authentication. | [1]https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2024-011/<br>[2]https://github.com/awslabs/aws-alb-route-directive-adapter-for-istio/security/advisories/GHSA-789x-wph8-m68r |
| 3 | CVE-2024-10002 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Rover IDX plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in versions up to, and including, 3.0.0.2905. This is due to insufficient validation and capability check on the `rover_idx_refresh_social_callback` function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to log in to administrator. The vulnerability is partially patched in version 3.0.0.2905 and fully patched in version 3.0.0.2906. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/rover-idx/tags/3.0.0.2903/admin/rover-panel-social.php#L153<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/rover-idx/tags/3.0.0.2903/rover-social-common.php#L148<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3173032/rover-idx/trunk/rover-social-common.php<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/5cf6a9fb-3c3b-48ad-a39b-77a529b89901?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2024-9627 | 8.6  | HIGH | The TeploBot - Telegram Bot for WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure due to missing authorization checks on the `service_process` function in all versions up to, and including, 1.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view the Telegram Bot Token, which is a secret token to control the bot. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/green-wp-telegram-bot-by-teplitsa/trunk/inc/core.php?rev=1754863#L266<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/091dadcb-71ac-4321-b3aa-72b5fbbd9163?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2024-9050 | 7.8  | HIGH | A flaw was found in the libreswan client plugin for NetworkManager (NetkworkManager-libreswan), where it fails to properly sanitize the VPN configuration from the local unprivileged user. In this configuration, composed by a key-value format, the plugin fails to escape special characters, leading the application to interpret values as keys. One of the most critical parameters that could be abused by a malicious user is the `leftupdown`key. This key takes an executable command as a value and is used to specify what executes as a callback in NetworkManager-libreswan to retrieve configuration settings back to NetworkManager. As NetworkManager uses Polkit to allow an unprivileged user to control the system`s network configuration, a malicious actor could achieve local privilege escalation and potential code execution as root in the targeted machine. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8312<br>[2]https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8338<br>[3]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-9050<br>[4]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2313828 |

| 11 | CVE-2022-23862 | 8.4  | HIGH | A Local Privilege Escalation issue was discovered in Y Soft SAFEQ 6 Build 53. The SafeQ JMX service running on port 9696 is vulnerable to JMX MLet attacks. Because the service did not enforce authentication and was running under the "NT Authority\System" user, an attacker is able to use the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code and elevate to the system user. | [1]https://github.com/mbadanoiu/CVE-2022-23862<br>[2]https://github.com/mbadanoiu/CVE-2022-23862/blob/main/SafeQ%20-%20CVE-2022-23862.pdf<br>[3]https://ysoft.com |
| 12 | CVE-2024-48605 | 7.8  | HIGH | An issue in Helakuru Desktop Application v1.1 allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code via the lack of proper validation of the wow64log.dll file. | [1]https://clement.notin.org/blog/2020/09/12/CVE-2020-7315-McAfee-Agent-DLL-injection/<br>[2]https://github.com/surajhacx/HelakuruV.1.1-DLLHijack<br>[3]https://medium.com/%40xNEED/dll-hijacking-jagexlauncher-819599165822<br>[4]https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51461 |
| 13 | CVE-2024-45518 | 7.5  | HIGH | An issue was discovered in Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) 10.1.x before 10.1.1, 10.0.x before 10.0.9, 9.0.0 before Patch 41, and 8.8.15 before Patch 46. It allows authenticated users to exploit Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to improper input sanitization and misconfigured domain whitelisting. This issue permits unauthorized HTTP requests to be sent to internal services, which can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) by chaining Command Injection within the internal service. When combined with existing XSS vulnerabilities, this SSRF issue can further facilitate Remote Code Execution (RCE). | [1]https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Security_Center<br>[2]https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/10.0.9#Security_Fixes<br>[3]https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/10.1.1#Security_Fixes<br>[4]https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/8.8.15/P46#Security_Fixes<br>[5]https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/9.0.0/P41#Security_Fixes<br>[6]https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Responsible_Disclosure_Policy<br>[7]https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Security_Advisories |
