| 17 | CVE-2025-4960 | 7.8  | HIGH | The com.epson.InstallNavi.helper tool, deployed with the EPSON printer driver installer, contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability due to multiple flaws in its implementation. It fails to properly authenticate clients over the XPC protocol and does not correctly enforce macOS’s authorization model, exposing privileged functionality to untrusted users. Although it invokes the AuthorizationCopyRights API, it does so using overly permissive custom rights that it registers in the system’s authorization database (/var/db/auth.db).These rights can be requested and granted by the authorization daemon to any local user, regardless of privilege level. As a result, an attacker can exploit the vulnerable service to perform privileged operations such as executing arbitrary commands or installing system components without requiring administrative credentials. | [1]https://pentraze.com/vulnerability-reports/<br>[2]https://pentraze.com/vulnerability-reports/cve-2025-4960/ |

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user`s passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/s2member/tags/260127/src/includes/classes/registrations.inc.php#L74<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3461625/s2member#file5<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6c31cf92-26b7-484d-8c93-ce241d655d07?source=cve |
| 23 | CVE-2026-25232 | 8.8  | HIGH | Gogs is an open source self-hosted Git service. Versions 0.13.4 and below have an access control bypass vulnerability which allows any repository collaborator with Write permissions to delete protected branches (including the default branch) by sending a direct POST request, completely bypassing the branch protection mechanism. This vulnerability in the DeleteBranchPost function eenables privilege escalation from Write to Admin level, allowing low-privilege users to perform dangerous operations that should be restricted to administrators only. Although Git Hook layer correctly prevents protected branch deletion via SSH push, the web interface deletion operation does not trigger Git Hooks, resulting in complete bypass of protection mechanisms. In oder to exploit this vulnerability, attackers must have write permissions to the target repository, protected branches configured to the target repository and access to the Gogs web interface. This issue has been fixed in version 0.14.1. | [1]https://github.com/gogs/gogs/commit/7b7e38c88007a7c482dbf31efff896185fd9b79c<br>[2]https://github.com/gogs/gogs/pull/8124<br>[3]https://github.com/gogs/gogs/releases/tag/v0.14.1<br>[4]https://github.com/gogs/gogs/security/advisories/GHSA-2c6v-8r3v-gh6p |
| 24 | CVE-2026-25242 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Gogs is an open source self-hosted Git service. Versions 0.13.4 and below expose unauthenticated file upload endpoints by default. When the global RequireSigninView setting is disabled (default), any remote user can upload arbitrary files to the server via /releases/attachments and /issues/attachments. This enables the instance to be abused as a public file host, potentially leading to disk exhaustion, content hosting, or delivery of malware. CSRF tokens do not mitigate this attack due to same-origin cookie issuance. This issue has been fixed in version 0.14.1. | [1]https://github.com/gogs/gogs/commit/628216d5889fcb838c471f4754f09b935d9cd9f3<br>[2]https://github.com/gogs/gogs/pull/8128<br>[3]https://github.com/gogs/gogs/releases/tag/v0.14.1<br>[4]https://github.com/gogs/gogs/security/advisories/GHSA-fc3h-92p8-h36f |
| 25 | CVE-2026-25474 | 7.5  | HIGH | OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. In versions 2026.1.30 and below, if channels.telegram.webhookSecret is not set when in Telegram webhook mode, OpenClaw may accept webhook HTTP requests without verifying Telegram’s secret token header. In deployments where the webhook endpoint is reachable by an attacker, this can allow forged Telegram updates (for example spoofing message.from.id). If an attacker can reach the webhook endpoint, they may be able to send forged updates that are processed as if they came from Telegram. Depending on enabled commands/tools and configuration, this could lead to unintended bot actions. Note: Telegram webhook mode is not enabled by default. It is enabled only when `channels.telegram.webhookUrl` is configured. This issue has been fixed in version 2026.2.1. | [1]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/commit/3cbcba10cf30c2ffb898f0d8c7dfb929f15f8930<br>[2]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/commit/5643a934799dc523ec2ef18c007e1aa2c386b670<br>[3]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/commit/633fe8b9c17f02fcc68ecdb5ec212a5ace932f09<br>[4]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/commit/ca92597e1f9593236ad86810b66633144b69314d<br>[5]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases/tag/v2026.2.1<br>[6]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-mp5h-m6qj-6292 |

| 66 | CVE-2026-26202 | 7.5  | HIGH | Penpot is an open-source design tool for design and code collaboration. Prior to version 2.13.2, an authenticated user can read arbitrary files from the server by supplying a local file path (e.g. `/etc/passwd`) as a font data chunk in the `create-font-variant` RPC endpoint, resulting in the file contents being stored and retrievable as a "font" asset. This is an arbitrary file read vulnerability. Any authenticated user with team edit permissions can read arbitrary files accessible to the Penpot backend process on the host filesystem. This can lead to exposure of sensitive system files, application secrets, database credentials, and private keys, potentially enabling further compromise of the server. In containerized deployments, the blast radius may be limited to the container filesystem, but environment variables, mounted secrets, and application configuration are still at risk.

| 67 | CVE-2026-26267 | 7.5  | HIGH | soroban-sdk is a Rust SDK for Soroban contracts. Prior to versions 22.0.10, 23.5.2, and 25.1.1, the `#[contractimpl]` macro contains a bug in how it wires up function calls. `#[contractimpl]` generates code that uses `MyContract::value()` style calls even when it`s processing the trait version. This means if an inherent function is also defined with the same name, the inherent function gets called instead of the trait function. This means the Wasm-exported entry point silently calls the wrong function when two conditions are met simultaneously: First, an `impl Trait for MyContract` block is defined with one or more functions, with `#[contractimpl]` applied. Second, an `impl MyContract` block is defined with one or more identically named functions, without `#[contractimpl]` applied. If the trait version contains important security checks, such as verifying the caller is authorized, that the inherent version does not, those checks are bypassed. Anyone interacting with the contract through its public interface will call the wrong function. The problem is patched in `soroban-sdk-macros` versions 22.0.10, 23.5.2, and 25.1.1. The fix changes the generated call from `<Type>::func()` to `<Type as Trait>::func()` when processing trait implementations, ensuring Rust resolves to the trait associated function regardless of whether an inherent function with the same name exists. Users should upgrade to `soroban-sdk-macros` 22.0.10, 23.5.2, or 25.1.1 and recompile their contracts. If upgrading is not immediately possible, contract developers can avoid the issue by ensuring that no inherent associated function on the contract type shares a name with any function in the trait implementation. Renaming or removing the conflicting inherent function eliminates the ambiguity and causes the macro-generated code to correctly resolve to the trait function. | [1]https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/commit/e92a3933e5f92dc09da3c740cf6a360d55709a2b<br>[2]https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/pull/1729<br>[3]https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/pull/1730<br>[4]https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/pull/1731<br>[5]https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-4chv-4c6w-w254 |

| 69 | CVE-2026-26280 | 8.4  | HIGH | systeminformation is a System and OS information library for node.js. In versions prior to 5.30.8, a command injection vulnerability in the `wifiNetworks()` function allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands via an unsanitized network interface parameter in the retry code path. In `lib/wifi.js`, the `wifiNetworks()` function sanitizes the `iface` parameter on the initial call (line 437). However, when the initial scan returns empty results, a `setTimeout` retry (lines 440-441) calls `getWifiNetworkListIw(iface)` with the **original unsanitized** `iface` value, which is passed directly to `execSync(`iwlist ${iface} scan`)`. Any application passing user-controlled input to `si.wifiNetworks()` is vulnerable to arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the Node.js process. Version 5.30.8 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/commit/22242aa56188f2bffcbd7d265a11e1ebb808b460<br>[2]https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/security/advisories/GHSA-9c88-49p5-5ggf |

| 71 | CVE-2026-27013 | 7.6  | HIGH | Fabric.js is a Javascript HTML5 canvas library. Prior to version 7.2.0, Fabric.js applies `escapeXml()` to text content during SVG export (`src/shapes/Text/TextSVGExportMixin.ts:186`) but fails to apply it to other user-controlled string values that are interpolated into SVG attribute markup. When attacker-controlled JSON is loaded via `loadFromJSON()` and later exported via `toSVG()`, the unescaped values break out of XML attributes and inject arbitrary SVG elements including event handlers. Any application that accepts user-supplied JSON (via `loadFromJSON()`, collaborative sharing, import features, CMS plugins) and renders the `toSVG()` output in a browser context (SVG preview, export download rendered in-page, email template, embed) is vulnerable to stored XSS. An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim`s browser session. Version 7.2.0 contains a fix. | [1]https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js/commit/7e1a122defd8feefe4eb7eaf0c180d7b0aeb6fee<br>[2]https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js/releases/tag/v720<br>[3]https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js/security/advisories/GHSA-hfvx-25r5-qc3w |

| 73 | CVE-2026-26275 | 7.5  | HIGH | httpsig-hyper is a hyper extension for http message signatures. An issue was discovered in `httpsig-hyper` prior to version 0.0.23 where Digest header verification could incorrectly succeed due to misuse of Rust`s `matches!` macro. Specifically, the comparison `if matches!(digest, _expected_digest)` treated `_expected_digest` as a pattern binding rather than a value comparison, resulting in unconditional success of the match expression. As a consequence, digest verification could incorrectly return success even when the computed digest did not match the expected value. Applications relying on Digest verification as part of HTTP message signature validation may therefore fail to detect message body modification. The severity depends on how the library is integrated and whether additional signature validation layers are enforced. This issue has been fixed in `httpsig-hyper` 0.0.23. The fix replaces the incorrect `matches!` usage with proper value comparison and additionally introduces constant-time comparison for digest verification as defense-in-depth. Regression tests have also been added to prevent reintroduction of this issue. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to the patched version. There is no reliable workaround without upgrading. Users who cannot immediately upgrade should avoid relying solely on Digest verification for message integrity and ensure that full HTTP message signature verification is enforced at the application layer. | [1]https://github.com/junkurihara/httpsig-rs/commit/5533f596c650377e02f4aa9e3eb8dba591b87370<br>[2]https://github.com/junkurihara/httpsig-rs/commit/65cbd19b395180a4bba09a89746c4b14ccb8d297<br>[3]https://github.com/junkurihara/httpsig-rs/pull/14<br>[4]https://github.com/junkurihara/httpsig-rs/pull/15<br>[5]https://github.com/junkurihara/httpsig-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-7v42-g35v-xrch |
| 74 | CVE-2026-26316 | 7.5  | HIGH | OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to 2026.2.13, the optional BlueBubbles iMessage channel plugin could accept webhook requests as authenticated based only on the TCP peer address being loopback (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `::ffff:127.0.0.1`) even when the configured webhook secret was missing or incorrect. This does not affect the default iMessage integration unless BlueBubbles is installed and enabled. Version 2026.2.13 contains a patch. Other mitigations include setting a non-empty BlueBubbles webhook password and avoiding deployments where a public-facing reverse proxy forwards to a loopback-bound Gateway without strong upstream authentication. | [1]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/commit/743f4b28495cdeb0d5bf76f6ebf4af01f6a02e5a<br>[2]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/commit/f836c385ffc746cb954e8ee409f99d079bfdcd2f<br>[3]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases/tag/v2026.2.13<br>[4]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-pchc-86f6-8758 |
| 75 | CVE-2026-26317 | 7.1  | HIGH | OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to 2026.2.14, browser-facing localhost mutation routes accepted cross-origin browser requests without explicit Origin/Referer validation. Loopback binding reduces remote exposure but does not prevent browser-initiated requests from malicious origins. A malicious website can trigger unauthorized state changes against a victim`s local OpenClaw browser control plane (for example opening tabs, starting/stopping the browser, mutating storage/cookies) if the browser control service is reachable on loopback in the victim`s browser context. Starting in version 2026.2.14, mutating HTTP methods (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) are rejected when the request indicates a non-loopback Origin/Referer (or `Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site`). Other mitigations include enabling browser control auth (token/password) and avoid running with auth disabled. | [1]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/commit/b566b09f81e2b704bf9398d8d97d5f7a90aa94c3<br>[2]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases/tag/v2026.2.14<br>[3]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-3fqr-4cg8-h96q |

| 77 | CVE-2026-26319 | 7.5  | HIGH | OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Versions 2026.2.13 and below allow the optional @openclaw/voice-call plugin Telnyx webhook handler to accept unsigned inbound webhook requests when telnyx.publicKey is not configured, enabling unauthenticated callers to forge Telnyx events. Telnyx webhooks are expected to be authenticated via Ed25519 signature verification. In affected versions, TelnyxProvider.verifyWebhook() could effectively fail open when no Telnyx public key was configured, allowing arbitrary HTTP POST requests to the voice-call webhook endpoint to be treated as legitimate Telnyx events. This only impacts deployments where the Voice Call plugin is installed, enabled, and the webhook endpoint is reachable from the attacker (for example, publicly exposed via a tunnel/proxy). The issue has been fixed in version 2026.2.14. | [1]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/commit/29b587e73cbdc941caec573facd16e87d52f007b<br>[2]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/commit/f47584fec86d6d73f2d483043a2ad0e7e3c50411<br>[3]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases/tag/v2026.2.14<br>[4]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-4hg8-92x6-h2f3 |
| 78 | CVE-2026-26321 | 7.5  | HIGH | OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to OpenClaw version 2026.2.14, the Feishu extension previously allowed `sendMediaFeishu` to treat attacker-controlled `mediaUrl` values as local filesystem paths and read them directly. If an attacker can influence tool calls (directly or via prompt injection), they may be able to exfiltrate local files by supplying paths such as `/etc/passwd` as `mediaUrl`. Upgrade to OpenClaw `2026.2.14` or newer to receive a fix. The fix removes direct local file reads from this path and routes media loading through hardened helpers that enforce local-root restrictions. | [1]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/commit/5b4121d6011a48c71e747e3c18197f180b872c5d<br>[2]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases/tag/v2026.2.14<br>[3]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-8jpq-5h99-ff5r |
| 79 | CVE-2026-26322 | 7.6  | HIGH | OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to OpenClaw version 2026.2.14, the Gateway tool accepted a tool-supplied `gatewayUrl` without sufficient restrictions, which could cause the OpenClaw host to attempt outbound WebSocket connections to user-specified targets. This requires the ability to invoke tools that accept `gatewayUrl` overrides (directly or indirectly). In typical setups this is limited to authenticated operators, trusted automation, or environments where tool calls are exposed to non-operators. In other words, this is not a drive-by issue for arbitrary internet users unless a deployment explicitly allows untrusted users to trigger these tool calls. Some tool call paths allowed `gatewayUrl` overrides to flow into the Gateway WebSocket client without validation or allowlisting. This meant the host could be instructed to attempt connections to non-gateway endpoints (for example, localhost services, private network addresses, or cloud metadata IPs). In the common case, this results in an outbound connection attempt from the OpenClaw host (and corresponding errors/timeouts). In environments where the tool caller can observe the results, this can also be used for limited network reachability probing. If the target speaks WebSocket and is reachable, further interaction may be possible. Starting in version 2026.2.14, tool-supplied `gatewayUrl` overrides are restricted to loopback (on the configured gateway port) or the configured `gateway.remote.url`. Disallowed protocols, credentials, query/hash, and non-root paths are rejected. | [1]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/commit/c5406e1d2434be2ef6eb4d26d8f1798d718713f4<br>[2]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases/tag/v2026.2.14<br>[3]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-g6q9-8fvw-f7rf |
| 80 | CVE-2026-26324 | 7.5  | HIGH | OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to version 2026.2.14, OpenClaw`s SSRF protection could be bypassed using full-form IPv4-mapped IPv6 literals such as `0:0:0:0:0:ffff:7f00:1` (which is `127.0.0.1`). This could allow requests that should be blocked (loopback / private network / link-local metadata) to pass the SSRF guard.

| 81 | CVE-2026-26325 | 7.2  | HIGH | OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to version 2026.2.14, a mismatch between `rawCommand` and `command[]` in the node host `system.run` handler could cause allowlist/approval evaluation to be performed on one command while executing a different argv. This only impacts deployments that use the node host / companion node execution path (`system.run` on a node), enable allowlist-based exec policy (`security=allowlist`) with approval prompting driven by allowlist misses (for example `ask=on-miss`), allow an attacker to invoke `system.run`. Default/non-node configurations are not affected. Version 2026.2.14 enforces `rawCommand`/`command[]` consistency (gateway fail-fast + node host validation). | [1]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/commit/cb3290fca32593956638f161d9776266b90ab891<br>[2]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases/tag/v2026.2.14<br>[3]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-h3f9-mjwj-w476 |
