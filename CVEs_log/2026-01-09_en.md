| 13 | CVE-2026-21869 | 8.8  | HIGH | llama.cpp is an inference of several LLM models in C/C++. In commits 55d4206c8 and prior, the n_discard parameter is parsed directly from JSON input in the llama.cpp server`s completion endpoints without validation to ensure it`s non-negative. When a negative value is supplied and the context fills up, llama_memory_seq_rm/add receives a reversed range and negative offset, causing out-of-bounds memory writes in the token evaluation loop. This deterministic memory corruption can crash the process or enable remote code execution (RCE). There is no fix at the time of publication. | [1]https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/security/advisories/GHSA-8947-pfff-2f3c<br>[2]https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/security/advisories/GHSA-8947-pfff-2f3c |
| 14 | CVE-2026-21875 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | ClipBucket v5 is an open source video sharing platform. Versions 5.5.2-#187 and below allow an attacker to perform Blind SQL Injection through the add comment section within a channel. When adding a comment within a channel, there is a POST request to the /actions/ajax.php endpoint. The obj_id parameter within the POST request to /actions/ajax.php is then used within the user_exists function of the upload/includes/classes/user.class. php file as the $id parameter. It is then used within the count function of the upload/includes/classes/db.class. php file. The $id parameter is concatenated into the query without validation or sanitization, and a user-supplied input like 1` or 1=1-- - can be used to trigger the injection. This issue does not have a fix at the time of publication. | [1]https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/security/advisories/GHSA-crpv-fmc4-j392<br>[2]https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/security/advisories/GHSA-crpv-fmc4-j392 |
| 15 | CVE-2026-21868 | 7.5  | HIGH | Flag Forge is a Capture The Flag (CTF) platform. Versions 2.3.2 and below have a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the user profile API endpoint (/api/user/[username]). The application constructs a regular expression dynamically using unescaped user input (the username parameter). An attacker can exploit this by sending a specially crafted username containing regex meta-characters (e.g., deeply nested groups or quantifiers), causing the MongoDB regex engine to consume excessive CPU resources. This can lead to Denial of Service for other users. The issue is fixed in version 2.3.3. To workaround this issue, implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) rule to block requests containing regex meta-characters in the URL path. | [1]https://github.com/FlagForgeCTF/flagForge/security/advisories/GHSA-949h-9824-xmcx |
| 16 | CVE-2026-21877 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. In versions 0.121.2 and below, an authenticated attacker may be able to execute malicious code using the n8n service. This could result in full compromise and can impact both self-hosted and n8n Cloud instances. This issue is fixed in version 1.121.3. Administrators can reduce exposure by disabling the Git node and limiting access for untrusted users, but upgrading to the latest version is recommended. | [1]https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/commit/f4b009d00d1f4ba9359b8e8f1c071e3d910a55f6<br>[2]https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/security/advisories/GHSA-v364-rw7m-3263 |

This allows any LAN-adjacent attacker to trivially gain root shell access and execute arbitrary commands with full privileges. | [1]https://github.com/actuator/cve/blob/main/KAYSUS/CVE-2025-68716.txt<br>[2]https://github.com/actuator/cve/tree/main/KAYSUS<br>[3]https://www.kaysus.com/ks_wr3600__wifi_7_be3600_wireless_router.html |
| 90 | CVE-2025-68717 | 9.4  | CRITICAL | KAYSUS KS-WR3600 routers with firmware 1.0.5.9.1 allow authentication bypass during session validation. If any user is logged in, endpoints such as /cgi-bin/system-tool accept unauthenticated requests with empty or invalid session values. This design flaw lets attackers piggyback on another user`s active session to retrieve sensitive configuration data or execute privileged actions without authentication. | [1]https://github.com/actuator/cve/blob/main/KAYSUS/CVE-2025-68717.txt<br>[2]https://github.com/actuator/cve/tree/main/KAYSUS<br>[3]https://www.kaysus.com/ks_wr3600__wifi_7_be3600_wireless_router.html |
| 91 | CVE-2025-68719 | 8.8  | HIGH | KAYSUS KS-WR3600 routers with firmware 1.0.5.9.1 mishandle configuration management. Once any user is logged in and maintains an active session, an attacker can directly query the backup endpoint and download a full configuration archive. This archive contains sensitive files such as /etc/shadow, enabling credential recovery and potential full compromise of the device. | [1]https://github.com/actuator/cve/blob/main/KAYSUS/CVE-2025-68719.txt<br>[2]https://github.com/actuator/cve/tree/main/KAYSUS<br>[3]https://www.kaysus.com/ks_wr3600__wifi_7_be3600_wireless_router.html |
| 92 | CVE-2025-14436 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Brevo for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘user_connection_id’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.49 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woocommerce-sendinblue-newsletter-subscription/trunk/src/managers/admin-manager.php#L59<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woocommerce-sendinblue-newsletter-subscription/trunk/src/views/admin_menus.php#L728<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woocommerce-sendinblue-newsletter-subscription/trunk/woocommerce-sendinblue.php#L164<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woocommerce-sendinblue-newsletter-subscription/trunk/woocommerce-sendinblue.php#L171<br>[5]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woocommerce-sendinblue-newsletter-subscription/trunk/woocommerce-sendinblue.php#L188<br>[6]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3434903/woocommerce-sendinblue-newsletter-subscription<br>[7]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/670f4e26-75c9-40cd-8088-2fa4c40f6feb?source=cve |
