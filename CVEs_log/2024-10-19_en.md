| 1 | CVE-2024-10118 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | SECOM WRTR-304GN-304TW-UPSC does not properly filter user input in the specific functionality. Unauthenticated remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability to inject and execute arbitrary system commands on the device. | [1]https://www.twcert.org.tw/en/cp-139-8155-c1ea6-2.html<br>[2]https://www.twcert.org.tw/tw/cp-132-8154-69fa5-1.html |
| 2 | CVE-2024-9264 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | The SQL Expressions experimental feature of Grafana allows for the evaluation of `duckdb` queries containing user input. These queries are insufficiently sanitized before being passed to `duckdb`, leading to a command injection and local file inclusion vulnerability. Any user with the VIEWER or higher permission is capable of executing this attack.  The `duckdb` binary must be present in Grafana`s $PATH for this attack to function; by default, this binary is not installed in Grafana distributions. | [1]https://grafana.com/security/security-advisories/cve-2024-9264/ |
