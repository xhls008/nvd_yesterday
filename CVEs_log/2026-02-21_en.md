| 1 | CVE-2026-26959 | 7.8  | HIGH | ADB Explorer is a fluent UI for ADB on Windows. Versions 0.9.26020 and below fail to validate the integrity or authenticity of the ADB binary path specified in the ManualAdbPath setting before executing it, allowing arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the current user. An attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious App.txt settings file that points ManualAdbPath to an arbitrary executable, then convincing a victim to launch the application with a command-line argument directing it to the malicious configuration directory. This vulnerability could be leveraged through social engineering tactics, such as distributing a shortcut bundled with a crafted settings file in an archive, resulting in RCE upon application startup. Thus issue has been fixed in version 0.9.26021. | [1]https://github.com/Alex4SSB/ADB-Explorer/commit/1b9fed20e875f5e74fd04e9889402f969c2d34e4<br>[2]https://github.com/Alex4SSB/ADB-Explorer/releases/tag/v0.9.26021<br>[3]https://github.com/Alex4SSB/ADB-Explorer/security/advisories/GHSA-gcgv-2jq7-74rp |
| 2 | CVE-2026-27001 | 7.8  | HIGH | OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to version 2026.2.15, OpenClaw embedded the current working directory (workspace path) into the agent system prompt without sanitization. If an attacker can cause OpenClaw to run inside a directory whose name contains control/format characters (for example newlines or Unicode bidi/zero-width markers), those characters could break the prompt structure and inject attacker-controlled instructions. Starting in version 2026.2.15, the workspace path is sanitized before it is embedded into any LLM prompt output, stripping Unicode control/format characters and explicit line/paragraph separators. Workspace path resolution also applies the same sanitization as defense-in-depth. | [1]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/commit/6254e96acf16e70ceccc8f9b2abecee44d606f79<br>[2]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases/tag/v2026.2.15<br>[3]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-2qj5-gwg2-xwc4 |
| 3 | CVE-2026-27002 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to version 2026.2.15, a configuration injection issue in the Docker tool sandbox could allow dangerous Docker options (bind mounts, host networking, unconfined profiles) to be applied, enabling container escape or host data access. OpenClaw 2026.2.15 blocks dangerous sandbox Docker settings and includes runtime enforcement when building `docker create` args; config-schema validation for `network=host`, `seccompProfile=unconfined`, `apparmorProfile=unconfined`; and security audit findings to surface dangerous sandbox docker config. As a workaround, do not configure `agents.*.sandbox.docker.binds` to mount system directories or Docker socket paths, keep `agents.*.sandbox.docker.network` at `none` (default) or `bridge`, and do not use `unconfined` for seccomp/AppArmor profiles. | [1]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/commit/887b209db47f1f9322fead241a1c0b043fd38339<br>[2]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases/tag/v2026.2.15<br>[3]https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-w235-x559-36mg |
| 4 | CVE-2026-26975 | 8.8  | HIGH | Music Assistant is an open-source media library manager that integrates streaming services with connected speakers. Versions 2.6.3 and below allow unauthenticated network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations. The music/playlists/update API allows users to bypass the .m3u extension enforcement and write files anywhere on the filesystem, which is exacerbated by the container running as root. This can be exploited to achieve Remote Code Execution by writing a malicious .pth file to the Python site-packages directory, which will execute arbitrary commands when Python loads. This issue has been fixed in version 2.7.0. | [1]https://github.com/music-assistant/server/pull/2684<br>[2]https://github.com/music-assistant/server/releases/tag/2.7.0<br>[3]https://github.com/music-assistant/server/security/advisories/GHSA-7jcc-p6xr-835j |
| 5 | CVE-2026-26064 | 8.8  | HIGH | calibre is a cross-platform e-book manager for viewing, converting, editing, and cataloging e-books. Versions 9.2.1 and below contain a Path Traversal vulnerability that allows arbitrary file writes anywhere the user has write permissions. On Windows, this leads to Remote Code Execution by writing a payload to the Startup folder, which executes on next login. Function extract_pictures only checks startswith(`Pictures`), and does not sanitize `..` sequences. calibre`s own ZipFile.extractall() in utils/zipfile.py does sanitize `..` via _get_targetpath(), but extract_pictures() bypasses this by using manual zf.read() + open(). This issue has been fixed in version 9.3.0. | [1]https://github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre/commit/e1b5f9b45a5e8fa96c136963ad9a1d35e6adac62<br>[2]https://github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre/security/advisories/GHSA-72ch-3hqc-pgmp |
| 6 | CVE-2026-26065 | 8.8  | HIGH | calibre is a cross-platform e-book manager for viewing, converting, editing, and cataloging e-books. Versions 9.2.1 and below are vulnerable to Path Traversal through PDB readers (both 132-byte and 202-byte header variants) that allow arbitrary file writes with arbitrary extension and arbitrary content anywhere the user has write permissions. Files are written in `wb` mode, silently overwriting existing files. This can lead to potential code execution and Denial of Service through file corruption. This issue has been fixed in version 9.3.0. | [1]https://github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre/commit/b6da1c3878c06eb1356cb0ec1106cb66e0e9bfb8<br>[2]https://github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre/security/advisories/GHSA-vmfh-7mr7-pp2w |
| 7 | CVE-2026-26960 | 7.1  | HIGH | node-tar is a full-featured Tar for Node.js. When using default options in versions 7.5.7 and below, an attacker-controlled archive can create a hardlink inside the extraction directory that points to a file outside the extraction root, enabling arbitrary file read and write as the extracting user. Severity is high because the primitive bypasses path protections and turns archive extraction into a direct filesystem access primitive. This issue has been fixed in version 7.5.8. | [1]https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/commit/2cb1120bcefe28d7ecc719b41441ade59c52e384<br>[2]https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/commit/d18e4e1f846f4ddddc153b0f536a19c050e7499f<br>[3]https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-83g3-92jg-28cx |

| 11 | CVE-2026-26988 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | LibreNMS is an auto-discovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring tool. Versions 25.12.0 and below contain an SQL Injection vulnerability in the ajax_table.php endpoint. The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize user input when processing IPv6 address searches. Specifically, the address parameter is split into an address and a prefix, and the prefix portion is directly concatenated into the SQL query string without validation. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or database manipulation. This issue has been fixed in version 26.2.0. | [1]https://github.com/librenms/librenms/commit/15429580baba03ed1dd377bada1bde4b7a1175a1<br>[2]https://github.com/librenms/librenms/pull/18777<br>[3]https://github.com/librenms/librenms/security/advisories/GHSA-h3rv-q4rq-pqcv |
| 12 | CVE-2026-26990 | 8.8  | HIGH | LibreNMS is an auto-discovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring tool. Versions 25.12.0 and below have a Time-Based Blind SQL Injection vulnerability in address-search.inc.php via the address parameter. When a crafted subnet prefix is supplied, the prefix value is concatenated directly into an SQL query without proper parameter binding, allowing an attacker to manipulate query logic and infer database information through time-based conditional responses. This vulnerability requires authentication and is exploitable by any authenticated user. This issue has been fixedd in version 26.2.0. | [1]https://github.com/librenms/librenms/commit/15429580baba03ed1dd377bada1bde4b7a1175a1<br>[2]https://github.com/librenms/librenms/pull/18777<br>[3]https://github.com/librenms/librenms/security/advisories/GHSA-79q9-wc6p-cf92 |

| 14 | CVE-2026-26996 | 7.5  | HIGH | minimatch is a minimal matching utility for converting glob expressions into JavaScript RegExp objects. Versions 10.2.0 and below are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) when a glob pattern contains many consecutive * wildcards followed by a literal character that doesn`t appear in the test string. Each * compiles to a separate [^/]*? regex group, and when the match fails, V8`s regex engine backtracks exponentially across all possible splits. The time complexity is O(4^N) where N is the number of * characters. With N=15, a single minimatch() call takes ~2 seconds. With N=34, it hangs effectively forever. Any application that passes user-controlled strings to minimatch() as the pattern argument is vulnerable to DoS. This issue has been fixed in version 10.2.1. | [1]https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch/commit/2e111f3a79abc00fa73110195de2c0f2351904f5<br>[2]https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch/security/advisories/GHSA-3ppc-4f35-3m26 |

| 45 | CVE-2026-24891 | 7.5  | HIGH | openITCOCKPIT is an open source monitoring tool built for different monitoring engines like Nagios, Naemon and Prometheus. Versions 5.3.1 and below contain an unsafe deserialization sink in the Gearman worker implementation. The worker function registered as oitc_gearman calls PHP`s unserialize() on job payloads without enforcing class restrictions or validating data origin. While the intended deployment assumes only trusted internal components enqueue Gearman jobs, this trust boundary is not enforced in application code. In environments where the Gearman service or worker is exposed to untrusted systems, an attacker may submit crafted serialized payloads to trigger PHP Object Injection in the worker process. This vulnerability is exploitable when Gearman listens on non-local interfaces, network access to TCP/4730 is unrestricted, or untrusted systems can enqueue jobs. Default, correctly hardened deployments may not be immediately exploitable, but the unsafe sink remains present in code regardless of deployment configuration. Enforcing this trust boundary in code would significantly reduce risk and prevent exploitation in misconfigured environments. This issue has been fixed in version 5.4.0. | [1]https://github.com/openITCOCKPIT/openITCOCKPIT/releases/tag/openITCOCKPIT-5.4.0<br>[2]https://github.com/openITCOCKPIT/openITCOCKPIT/security/advisories/GHSA-x4mq-8gfg-frc4 |
| 46 | CVE-2026-27115 | 7.1  | HIGH | ADB Explorer is a fluent UI for ADB on Windows. Versions 0.9.26020 and below have an unvalidated command-line argument that allows any user to trigger recursive deletion of arbitrary directories on the Windows filesystem. ADB Explorer accepts an optional path argument to set a custom data directory, but only check whether the path exists. The ClearDrag() method calls Directory.Delete(dir, true) on every subdirectory of that path at both application startup and exit. An attacker can craft a malicious shortcut (.lnk) or batch script that launches ADB Explorer with a critical directory (e.g. C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents) as the argument, causing permanent recursive deletion of all its subdirectories. Any user who launches ADB Explorer via a crafted shortcut, batch file, or script loses the contents of the targeted directory permanently (deletion bypasses the Recycle Bin). This issue has been fixed in version 0.9.26021. | [1]https://github.com/Alex4SSB/ADB-Explorer/commit/f7554690b1f68c6066c12aa45aec60303bca545b<br>[2]https://github.com/Alex4SSB/ADB-Explorer/releases/tag/v0.9.26021<br>[3]https://github.com/Alex4SSB/ADB-Explorer/security/advisories/GHSA-rg2h-2p33-rxcr |

| 52 | CVE-2026-24892 | 7.5  | HIGH | openITCOCKPIT is an open source monitoring tool built for different monitoring engines like Nagios, Naemon and Prometheus. openITCOCKPIT Community Edition 5.3.1 and earlier contains an unsafe PHP deserialization pattern in the processing of changelog entries. Serialized changelog data derived from attacker-influenced application state is unserialized without restricting allowed classes. Although no current application endpoint was found to introduce PHP objects into this data path, the presence of an unrestricted unserialize() call constitutes a latent PHP object injection vulnerability. If future code changes, plugins, or refactors introduce object values into this path, the vulnerability could become immediately exploitable with severe impact, including potential remote code execution. | [1]https://github.com/openITCOCKPIT/openITCOCKPIT/commit/975e0d0dfb79898568afbbfdba8f647d92612a69<br>[2]https://github.com/openITCOCKPIT/openITCOCKPIT/releases/tag/openITCOCKPIT-5.4.0<br>[3]https://github.com/openITCOCKPIT/openITCOCKPIT/security/advisories/GHSA-g83p-vvjm-g39x |
