| 1 | CVE-2025-60017 | 8.2  | HIGH | Unitree Go2, G1, H1, and B2 devices through 2025-09-20 allow root OS command injection via the hostapd_restart.sh wifi_ssid or wifi_pass parameter (within restart_wifi_ap and restart_wifi_sta). | [1]https://github.com/Bin4ry/UniPwn<br>[2]https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45381590<br>[3]https://spectrum.ieee.org/unitree-robot-exploit |
| 2 | CVE-2025-10747 | 7.2  | HIGH | The WP-DownloadManager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the download-add.php file in all versions up to, and including, 1.68.11. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-downloadmanager/trunk/download-add.php#L35<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3364847%40wp-downloadmanager&new=3364847%40wp-downloadmanager&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[3]https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-downloadmanager/<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/2c535cea-dad6-440f-b37f-6d196b469214?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2025-35027 | 7.3  | HIGH | Multiple robotic products by Unitree sharing a common firmware, including the Go2, G1, H1, and B2 devices, contain a command injection vulnerability. By setting a malicious string when configuring the on-board WiFi via a BLE module of an affected robot, then triggering a restart of the WiFi service, an attacker can ultimately trigger commands to be run as root via the wpa_supplicant_restart.sh shell script. All Unitree models use firmware derived from the same codebase (MIT Cheetah), and the two major forks are the G1 (humanoid) and Go2 (quadruped) branches. | [1]https://github.com/Bin4ry/UniPwn<br>[2]https://spectrum.ieee.org/unitree-robot-exploit<br>[3]https://takeonme.org/cves/cve-2025-35027<br>[4]https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2025-60017<br>[5]https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2025-60250<br>[6]https://x.com/committeeonccp/status/1971250635548033311 |
| 4 | CVE-2025-54831 | 7.5  | HIGH | Apache Airflow 3 introduced a change to the handling of sensitive information in Connections. The intent was to restrict access to sensitive connection fields to Connection Editing Users, effectively applying a "write-only" model for sensitive values.In Airflow 3.0.3, this model was unintentionally violated: sensitive connection information could be viewed by users with READ permissions through both the API and the UI. This behavior also bypassed the `AIRFLOW__CORE__HIDE_SENSITIVE_VAR_CONN_FIELDS` configuration option.This issue does not affect Airflow 2.x, where exposing sensitive information to connection editors was the intended and documented behavior.Users of Airflow 3.0.3 are advised to upgrade Airflow to >=3.0.4. | [1]https://lists.apache.org/thread/vblmfqtydrp5zgn2q8tj3slk5podxspf |

| 6 | CVE-2025-11021 | 7.5  | HIGH | A flaw was found in the cookie date handling logic of the libsoup HTTP library, widely used by GNOME and other applications for web communication. When processing cookies with specially crafted expiration dates, the library may perform an out-of-bounds memory read. This flaw could result in unintended disclosure of memory contents, potentially exposing sensitive information from the process using libsoup. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-11021<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2399627 |

| 46 | CVE-2025-59845 | 8.2  | HIGH | Apollo Studio Embeddable Explorer & Embeddable Sandbox are website embeddable software solutions from Apollo GraphQL. Prior to Apollo Sandbox version 2.7.2 and Apollo Explorer version 3.7.3, a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability was identified. The vulnerability arises from missing origin validation in the client-side code that handles window.postMessage events. A malicious website can send forged messages to the embedding page, causing the victim’s browser to execute arbitrary GraphQL queries or mutations against their GraphQL server while authenticated with the victim’s cookies. This issue has been patched in Apollo Sandbox version 2.7.2 and Apollo Explorer version 3.7.3. | [1]https://github.com/apollographql/embeddable-explorer/security/advisories/GHSA-w87v-7w53-wwxv |
| 47 | CVE-2025-59934 | 9.4  | CRITICAL | Formbricks is an open source qualtrics alternative. Prior to version 4.0.1, Formbricks is missing JWT signature verification. This vulnerability stems from a token validation routine that only decodes JWTs (jwt.decode) without verifying their signatures. Both the email verification token login path and the password reset server action use the same validator, which does not check the token’s signature, expiration, issuer, or audience. If an attacker learns the victim’s actual user.id, they can craft an arbitrary JWT with an alg: "none" header and use it to authenticate and reset the victim’s password.
