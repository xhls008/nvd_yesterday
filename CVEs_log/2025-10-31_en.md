| 7 | CVE-2025-54469 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | A vulnerability was identified in NeuVector, where the enforcer used environment variables CLUSTER_RPC_PORT and CLUSTER_LAN_PORT to generate a command to be executed via popen, without first sanitising their values.The entry process of the enforcer container is the monitor process. When the enforcer container stops, the monitor process checks whether the consul subprocess has exited. To perform this check, the monitor process uses the popen function to execute a shell command that determines whether the ports used by the consul subprocess are still active.The values of environment variables CLUSTER_RPC_PORT and CLUSTER_LAN_PORT are used directly to compose shell commands via popen without validation or sanitization.  This behavior could allow a malicious user to inject malicious commands through these variables within the enforcer container. | [1]https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2025-54469<br>[2]https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector/security/advisories/GHSA-c8g6-qrwh-m3vp |
| 8 | CVE-2025-54470 | 8.6  | HIGH | This vulnerability affects NeuVector deployments only when the Report anonymous cluster data option is enabled. When this option is enabled, NeuVector sends anonymous telemetry data to the telemetry server.In affected versions, NeuVector does not enforce TLS certificate verification when transmitting anonymous cluster data to the telemetry server. As a result, the communication channel is susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker could intercept or modify the transmitted data. Additionally, NeuVector loads the response of the telemetry server is loaded into memory without size limitation, which makes  it vulnerable to a Denial of Service(DoS) attack | [1]https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2025-54470<br>[2]https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector/security/advisories/GHSA-qqj3-g7mx-5p4w |

| 21 | CVE-2025-62712 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | JumpServer is an open source bastion host and an operation and maintenance security audit system. In JumpServer versions prior to v3.10.20-lts and v4.10.11-lts, an authenticated, non-privileged user can retrieve connection tokens belonging to other users via the super-connection API endpoint (/api/v1/authentication/super-connection-token/). When accessed from a web browser, this endpoint returns connection tokens created by all users instead of restricting results to tokens owned by or authorized for the requester. An attacker who obtains these tokens can use them to initiate connections to managed assets on behalf of the original token owners, resulting in unauthorized access and privilege escalation across sensitive systems. This vulnerability is fixed in v3.10.20-lts and v4.10.11-lts. | [1]https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/commit/453ad331eec9d9667a38de735d6612608e558491<br>[2]https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/security/advisories/GHSA-6ghx-6vpv-3wg7 |
