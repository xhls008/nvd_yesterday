| 22 | CVE-2025-59530 | 7.5  | HIGH | quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. In versions prior to 0.49.0, 0.54.1, and 0.55.0, a misbehaving or malicious server can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the quic-go client by triggering an assertion failure, leading to a process crash. This requires no authentication and can be exploited during the handshake phase. This was observed in the wild with certain server implementations. quic-go needs to be able to handle misbehaving server implementations, including those that prematurely send a HANDSHAKE_DONE frame. Versions 0.49.0, 0.54.1, and 0.55.0 discard Initial keys when receiving a HANDSHAKE_DONE frame, thereby correctly handling premature HANDSHAKE_DONE frames. | [1]https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/blob/v0.55.0/connection.go#L2682-L2685<br>[2]https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/pull/5354<br>[3]https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/security/advisories/GHSA-47m2-4cr7-mhcw |

| 32 | CVE-2025-61919 | 7.5  | HIGH | Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Prior to versions 2.2.20, 3.1.18, and 3.2.3, `Rack::Request#POST` reads the entire request body into memory for `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, calling `rack.input.read(nil)` without enforcing a length or cap. Large request bodies can therefore be buffered completely into process memory before parsing, leading to denial of service (DoS) through memory exhaustion. Users should upgrade to Rack version 2.2.20, 3.1.18, or 3.2.3, anu of which enforces form parameter limits using `query_parser.bytesize_limit`, preventing unbounded reads of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies. Additionally, enforce strict maximum body size at the proxy or web server layer (e.g., Nginx `client_max_body_size`, Apache `LimitRequestBody`). | [1]https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/4e2c903991a790ee211a3021808ff4fd6fe82881<br>[2]https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/cbd541e8a3d0c5830a3c9a30d3718ce2e124f9db<br>[3]https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/e179614c4a653283286f5f046428cbb85f21146f<br>[4]https://github.com/rack/rack/security/advisories/GHSA-6xw4-3v39-52mm |
| 33 | CVE-2025-61920 | 7.5  | HIGH | Authlib is a Python library which builds OAuth and OpenID Connect servers. Prior to version 1.6.5, Authlib’s JOSE implementation accepts unbounded JWS/JWT header and signature segments. A remote attacker can craft a token whose base64url‑encoded header or signature spans hundreds of megabytes. During verification, Authlib decodes and parses the full input before it is rejected, driving CPU and memory consumption to hostile levels and enabling denial of service. Version 1.6.5 patches the issue. Some temporary workarounds are available. Enforce input size limits before handing tokens to Authlib and/or use application-level throttling to reduce amplification risk. | [1]https://github.com/authlib/authlib/commit/867e3f87b072347a1ae9cf6983cc8bbf88447e5e<br>[2]https://github.com/authlib/authlib/security/advisories/GHSA-pq5p-34cr-23v9 |
| 34 | CVE-2025-61929 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | Cherry Studio is a desktop client that supports for multiple LLM providers. Cherry Studio registers a custom protocol called `cherrystudio://`. When handling the MCP installation URL, it parses the base64-encoded configuration data and directly executes the command within it. In the files `src/main/services/ProtocolClient.ts` and `src/main/services/urlschema/mcp-install.ts`, when receiving a URL of the `cherrystudio://mcp` type, the `handleMcpProtocolUrl` function is called for processing. If an attacker crafts malicious content and posts it on a website or elsewhere (there are many exploitation methods, such as creating a malicious website with a button containing this malicious content), when the user clicks it, since the pop-up window contains normal content, the direct click is considered a scene action, and the malicious command is directly triggered, leading to the user being compromised. As of time of publication, no known patched versions exist. | [1]https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio/security/advisories/GHSA-hh6w-rmjc-26f6 |
| 35 | CVE-2025-61930 | 8.1  | HIGH | Emlog is an open source website building system.

An attacker can trick a logged‑in administrator into submitting a crafted POST request to change the admin password without consent. Impact is account takeover of privileged users. Severity: High. As of time of publication, no known patched versions exist. | [1]https://github.com/emlog/emlog/security/advisories/GHSA-m2qw-9wjx-qxm2 |

| 39 | CVE-2025-62162 | 7.5  | HIGH | cel-rust is a Common Expression Language interpreter written in Rust. Starting in version 0.10.0 and prior to version 0.11.4, parsing certain malformed CEL expressions can cause the parser to panic, terminating the process. When the crate is used to evaluate untrusted expressions (e.g., user-supplied input over an API), an attacker can send crafted input to trigger a denial of service (DoS). Version 0.11.4 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/cel-rust/cel-rust/releases/tag/cel-v0.11.4<br>[2]https://github.com/cel-rust/cel-rust/security/advisories/GHSA-wxwx-9fh7-5mrw |
