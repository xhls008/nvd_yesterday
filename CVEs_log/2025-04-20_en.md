| 1 | CVE-2025-2010 | 7.5  | HIGH | The JobWP â€“ Job Board, Job Listing, Career Page and Recruitment Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the `jobwp_upload_resume` parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.9 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3271612/jobwp/tags/2.4.0/core/job_application.php?old=3230672&old_path=jobwp%2Ftags%2F2.3.9%2Fcore%2Fjob_application.php<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b3b658f0-b9d8-4b7f-8d40-39ce185ef797?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2025-3278 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The UrbanGo Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions up to, and including, 1.0.4. This is due to the plugin allowing users who are registering new accounts to set their own role or by supplying `user_register_role` field. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain elevated privileges by creating an account with the administrator role. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/urbango-directory-and-listing-wordpress-theme/22712624<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/913ffe0c-c8f8-4cda-be9a-96c056d4c4a8?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2025-1093 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The AIHub theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the generate_image function in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/ai-hub-startup-technology-wordpress-theme/47473638<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/09adfe7e-f154-4143-827f-957ded3ffc8f?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2025-3103 | 7.5  | HIGH | The CLEVER - HTML5 Radio Player With History - Shoutcast and Icecast - Elementor Widget Addon plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file read due to insufficient file path validation in the `history.php` file in all versions up to, and including, 2.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files on the affected site`s server, which may contain sensitive information including database credentials. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 2.4. | [1]https://codecanyon.net/item/clever-html5-radio-player-with-history-shoutcast-and-icecast-elementor-widget-addon/26708087#item-description__updates-release-log<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0733261f-a2e1-4bd1-a57d-fdaaa8c904db?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2025-2111 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Insert Headers And Footers plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the `custom_plugin_set_option` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site. The `WPBRIGADE_SDK__DEV_MODE` constant must be set to `true` to exploit the vulnerability. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-headers-and-footers/trunk/lib/wpb-sdk/views/wpb-debug.php#L63<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-headers-and-footers/trunk/lib/wpb-sdk/views/wpb-debug.php#L69<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3276361/<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/7b00d175-261d-46e3-bf3c-2d18f4e4972d?source=cve |
| 6 | CVE-2025-3809 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Debug Log Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the auto-refresh debug log in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3267252%40debug-log-manager&new=3267252%40debug-log-manager&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/cbc3210d-224e-4ed2-ada7-dc17deb17584?source=cve |
