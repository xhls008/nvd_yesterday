| 1 | CVE-2024-10932 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Backup Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.6 via deserialization of untrusted input in the `recursive_unserialize_replace` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain allows attackers to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. An administrator must create a staging site in order to trigger the exploit. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser//backup-backup/tags/1.4.6/includes/database/search-replace.php#L46<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/backup-backup/tags/1.4.6.1/includes/database/search-replace.php#L46<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d5a0c514-5200-47f4-9d2e-684d68946b9a?source=cve |
