| 31 | CVE-2025-49013 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | WilderForge is a Wildermyth coremodding API. A critical vulnerability has been identified in multiple projects across the WilderForge organization. The issue arises from unsafe usage of `${{ github.event.review.body }}` and other user controlled variables directly inside shell script contexts in GitHub Actions workflows. This introduces a code injection vulnerability: a malicious actor submitting a crafted pull request review containing shell metacharacters or commands could execute arbitrary shell code on the GitHub Actions runner. This can lead to arbitrary command execution with the permissions of the workflow, potentially compromising CI infrastructure, secrets, and build outputs. Developers who maintain or contribute to the repos WilderForge/WilderForge, WilderForge/ExampleMod, WilderForge/WilderWorkspace, WilderForge/WildermythGameProvider, WilderForge/AutoSplitter, WilderForge/SpASM, WilderForge/thrixlvault, WilderForge/MassHash, and/or WilderForge/DLC_Disabler; as well as users who fork any of the above repositories and reuse affected GitHub Actions workflows, are affected. End users of any the above software and users who only install pre-built releases or artifacts are not affected. This vulnerability does not impact runtime behavior of the software or compiled outputs unless those outputs were produced during exploitation of this vulnerability. A current workaround is to disable GitHub Actions in affected repositories, or remove the affected workflows. | [1]https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/javascript/js-actions-command-injection<br>[2]https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#preventing-script-injection<br>[3]https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#understanding-the-risk-of-script-injection<br>[4]https://github.com/WilderForge/WilderForge/security/advisories/GHSA-m6r3-c73x-8fw5<br>[5]https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input |

| 106 | CVE-2025-49136 | 9.0  | CRITICAL | listmonk is a standalone, self-hosted, newsletter and mailing list manager. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 5.0.2, the `env` and `expandenv` template functions which is enabled by default in Sprig enables capturing of env variables on host. While this may not be a problem on single-user (super admin) installations, on multi-user installations, this allows non-super-admin users with campaign or template permissions to use the `{{ env }}` template expression to capture sensitive environment variables. Users should upgrade to v5.0.2 to mitigate the issue. | [1]https://github.com/knadh/listmonk/commit/d27d2c32cf3af2d0b24e29ea5a686ba149b49b3e<br>[2]https://github.com/knadh/listmonk/releases/tag/v5.0.2<br>[3]https://github.com/knadh/listmonk/security/advisories/GHSA-jc7g-x28f-3v3h |

| 110 | CVE-2025-49004 | 7.5  | HIGH | Caido is a web security auditing toolkit. Prior to version 0.48.0, due to the lack of protection for DNS rebinding, Caido can be loaded on an attacker-controlled domain. This allows a malicious website to hijack the authentication flow of Caido and achieve code execution. A malicious website loaded in the browser can hijack the locally running Caido instance and achieve remote command execution during the initial setup. Even if the Caido instance is already configured, an attacker can initiate the authentication flow by performing DNS rebinding. In this case, the victim needs to authorize the request on dashboard.caido.io. Users should upgrade to version 0.48.0 to receive a patch. | [1]https://github.com/caido/caido/security/advisories/GHSA-jmxf-xw2r-vjrg |
| 111 | CVE-2025-49137 | 8.5  | HIGH | HAX CMS PHP allows users to manage their microsite universe with a PHP backend. Prior to version 11.0.0, the application does not sufficiently sanitize user input, allowing for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code. The `saveNode` and `saveManifest` endpoints take user input and store it in the JSON schema for the site. This content is then rendered in the generated HAX site. Although the application does not allow users to supply a `script` tag, it does allow the use of other HTML tags to run JavaScript. Version 11.0.0 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/haxtheweb/haxcms-php/commit/0dd3e98fe2fadd0793b667d4af2aac230980e0f8<br>[2]https://github.com/haxtheweb/issues/security/advisories/GHSA-2vc4-3hx7-v7v7 |
| 112 | CVE-2025-49141 | 8.5  | HIGH | HAX CMS PHP allows users to manage their microsite universe with a PHP backend. Prior to version 11.0.3, the `gitImportSite` functionality obtains a URL string from a POST request and insufficiently validates user input. The `set_remote` function later passes this input into `proc_open`, yielding OS command injection. An authenticated attacker can craft a URL string that bypasses the validation checks employed by the `filter_var` and `strpos` functions in order to execute arbitrary OS commands on the backend server. The attacker can exfiltrate command output via an HTTP request. Version 11.0.3 contains a patch for the issue. | [1]https://github.com/haxtheweb/haxcms-nodejs/commit/5131fea6b6be611db76a618f89bd2e164752e9b3<br>[2]https://github.com/haxtheweb/issues/security/advisories/GHSA-g4cf-pp4x-hqgw |

| 114 | CVE-2025-49140 | 7.5  | HIGH | Pion Interceptor is a framework for building RTP/RTCP communication software. Versions v0.1.36 through v0.1.38 contain a bug in a RTP packet factory that can be exploited to trigger a panic with Pion based SFU via crafted RTP packets, This only affect users that use pion/interceptor. Users should upgrade to v0.1.39 or later, which validates that: `padLen > 0 && padLen <= payloadLength` and return error  on overflow, avoiding panic. If upgrading is not possible, apply the patch from the pull request manually or drop packets whose P-bit is set but whose padLen is zero or larger than the remaining payload. | [1]https://github.com/pion/interceptor/commit/fa5b35ea867389cec33a9c82fffbd459ca8958e5<br>[2]https://github.com/pion/interceptor/pull/338<br>[3]https://github.com/pion/interceptor/security/advisories/GHSA-f26w-gh5m-qq77<br>[4]https://github.com/pion/webrtc/issues/3148 |
