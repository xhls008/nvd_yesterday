| 1 | CVE-2024-31225 | 8.3  | HIGH | RIOT is a real-time multi-threading operating system that supports a range of devices that are typically 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers. The `_on_rd_init()` function does not implement a size check before copying data to the `_result_buf` static buffer. If an attacker can craft a long enough payload, they could cause a buffer overflow. If the unchecked input above is attacker-controlled and crosses a security boundary, the impact of the buffer overflow vulnerability could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution. This issue has yet to be patched. Users are advised to add manual bounds checking. | [1]https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/master/sys/net/application_layer/cord/lc/cord_lc.c#L218<br>[2]https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/security/advisories/GHSA-2572-7q7c-3965 |
| 2 | CVE-2024-32017 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | RIOT is a real-time multi-threading operating system that supports a range of devices that are typically 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers. The size check in the `gcoap_dns_server_proxy_get()` function contains a small typo that may lead to a buffer overflow in the subsequent `strcpy()`. In detail, the length of the `_uri` string is checked instead of the length of the `_proxy` string. The `_gcoap_forward_proxy_copy_options()` function does not implement an explicit size check before copying data to the `cep->req_etag` buffer that is `COAP_ETAG_LENGTH_MAX` bytes long. If an attacker can craft input so that `optlen` becomes larger than `COAP_ETAG_LENGTH_MAX`, they can cause a buffer overflow. If the input above is attacker-controlled and crosses a security boundary, the impact of the buffer overflow vulnerabilities could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution. This issue has yet to be patched. Users are advised to add manual bounds checking. | [1]https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/master/sys/net/application_layer/gcoap/dns.c#L319-L325<br>[2]https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/master/sys/net/application_layer/gcoap/forward_proxy.c#L352<br>[3]https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/security/advisories/GHSA-v97j-w9m6-c4h3 |
| 3 | CVE-2024-32018 | 8.8  | HIGH | RIOT is a real-time multi-threading operating system that supports a range of devices that are typically 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers. Most codebases define assertion macros which compile to a no-op on non-debug builds. If assertions are the only line of defense against untrusted input, the software may be exposed to attacks that leverage the lack of proper input checks. In detail, in the `nimble_scanlist_update()` function below, `len` is checked in an assertion and subsequently used in a call to `memcpy()`. If an attacker is able to provide a larger `len` value while assertions are compiled-out, they can write past the end of the fixed-length `e->ad` buffer. If the unchecked input above is attacker-controlled and crosses a security boundary, the impact of the buffer overflow vulnerability could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution. This issue has not yet been patched. Users are advised to add manual `len` checking. | [1]https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/master/pkg/nimble/scanlist/nimble_scanlist.c#L74-L87<br>[2]https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/security/advisories/GHSA-899m-q6pp-hmp3 |
| 4 | CVE-2024-32979 | 7.5  | HIGH | Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform built as a web application atop the Django Python framework with a PostgreSQL or MySQL database. It was discovered that due to improper handling and escaping of user-provided query parameters, a maliciously crafted Nautobot URL could potentially be used to execute a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (Reflected XSS) attack against users. All filterable object-list views in Nautobot are vulnerable. This issue has been fixed in Nautobot versions 1.6.20 and 2.2.3. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/commit/42440ebd9b381534ad89d62420ebea00d703d64e<br>[2]https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/5646<br>[3]https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/5647<br>[4]https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-jxgr-gcj5-cqqg |
| 5 | CVE-2024-32984 | 7.5  | HIGH | Yamux is a stream multiplexer over reliable, ordered connections such as TCP/IP. The Rust implementation of the Yamux stream multiplexer uses a vector for pending frames. This vector is not bounded in length. Every time the Yamux protocol requires sending of a new frame, this frame gets appended to this vector. This can be remotely triggered in a number of ways, for example by: 1. Opening a new libp2p Identify stream. This causes the node to send its Identify message. Of course, every other protocol that causes the sending of data also works. The larger the response, the more data is enqueued. 2. Sending a Yamux Ping frame. This causes a Pong frame to be enqueued. Under normal circumstances, this queue of pending frames would be drained once they’re sent out over the network. However, the attacker can use TCP’s receive window mechanism to prevent the victim from sending out any data: By not reading from the TCP connection, the receive window will never be increased, and the victim won’t be able to send out any new data (this is how TCP implements backpressure). Once this happens, Yamux’s queue of pending frames will start growing indefinitely. The queue will only be drained once the underlying TCP connection is closed. An attacker can cause a remote node to run out of memory, which will result in the corresponding process getting terminated by the operating system. | [1]https://github.com/libp2p/rust-yamux/blob/yamux-v0.13.1/yamux/src/connection.rs#L289<br>[2]https://github.com/libp2p/rust-yamux/security/advisories/GHSA-3999-5ffv-wp2r<br>[3]https://github.com/sigp/rust-yamux/commit/6689e227a48258a52347cd1d984adfc94afc6f7a |
