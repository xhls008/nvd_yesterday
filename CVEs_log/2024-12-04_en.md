| 11 | CVE-2024-11391 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Advanced File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via the `class_fma_connector.php` file in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.10. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and granted permissions by an Administrator, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3199242/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/f14a658c-1517-4af4-8bd7-c379ac07ab35?source=cve |
| 12 | CVE-2024-53999 | 8.1  | HIGH | Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is a pen-testing, malware analysis and security assessment framework capable of performing static and dynamic analysis. The application allows users to upload files with scripts in the filename parameter. As a result, a malicious user can upload a script file to the system. When users in the application use the "Diff or Compare" functionality, they are affected by a Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.2.9. | [1]https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/commit/27d165872847f5ae7417caf09f37edeeba741e1e<br>[2]https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/security/advisories/GHSA-5jc6-h9w7-jm3p |
| 13 | CVE-2024-54000 | 7.5  | HIGH | Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is a pen-testing, malware analysis and security assessment framework capable of performing static and dynamic analysis. In versions prior to 3.9.7, the requests.get() request in the _check_url method is specified as allow_redirects=True, which allows a server-side request forgery when a request to .well-known/assetlinks.json" returns a 302 redirect. This is a bypass of the fix for CVE-2024-29190 and is fixed in 3.9.7. | [1]https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/commit/f22c584aa7d43527970c9da61eb678953cfc0a8e<br>[2]https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/security/advisories/GHSA-m435-9v6r-v5f6 |
| 14 | CVE-2024-37302 | 7.5  | HIGH | Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver. Synapse versions before 1.106 are vulnerable to a disk fill attack, where an unauthenticated adversary can induce Synapse to download and cache large amounts of remote media. The default rate limit strategy is insufficient to mitigate this. This can lead to a denial of service, ranging from further media uploads/downloads failing to completely unavailability of the Synapse process, depending on how Synapse was deployed. Synapse 1.106 introduces a new "leaky bucket" rate limit on remote media downloads to reduce the amount of data a user can request at a time. This does not fully address the issue, but does limit an unauthenticated user`s ability to request large amounts of data to be cached. | [1]https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-4mhg-xv73-xq2x |
| 15 | CVE-2024-40691 | 8.0  | HIGH | IBM Cognos Controller 11.0.0 and 11.0.1 could be vulnerable to malicious file upload by not validating the content of the file uploaded to the web interface. Attackers can make use of this weakness and upload malicious executable files into the system, and it can be sent to victim for performing further attacks. | [1]https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/7177220 |
| 16 | CVE-2024-41777 | 7.5  | HIGH | IBM Cognos Controller 11.0.0 and 11.0.1 contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key, which it uses for its own inbound authentication, outbound communication to external components, or encryption of internal data. | [1]https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/7177220 |
