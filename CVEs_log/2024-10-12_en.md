| 1 | CVE-2024-9822 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Pedalo Connector plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 2.0.5. This is due to insufficient restriction on the `login_admin_user` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log to the first user, who is usually the administrator, or if it does not exist, then to the first administrator. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/pedalo-connector/tags/2.0.5/public/class-pedalo_connector-public.php#L118<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6ab0d342-bfa7-4760-b839-37c3354414ca?source=cve |

| 10 | CVE-2024-45402 | 8.6  | HIGH | Picotls is a TLS protocol library that allows users select different crypto backends based on their use case. When parsing a spoofed TLS handshake message, picotls (specifically, bindings within picotls that call the crypto libraries) may attempt to free the same memory twice. This double free occurs during the disposal of multiple objects without any intervening calls to malloc Typically, this triggers the malloc implementation to detect the error and abort the process. However, depending on the internals of malloc and the crypto backend being used, the flaw could potentially lead to a use-after-free scenario, which might allow for arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability is addressed with commit 9b88159ce763d680e4a13b6e8f3171ae923a535d. | [1]https://github.com/h2o/picotls/commit/9b88159ce763d680e4a13b6e8f3171ae923a535d<br>[2]https://github.com/h2o/picotls/security/advisories/GHSA-w7c8-wjx9-vvvv |

| 26 | CVE-2024-47502 | 7.5  | HIGH | An Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling vulnerability in the kernel of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).In specific cases the state of TCP sessions that are terminated is not cleared, which over time leads to an exhaustion of resources, preventing new connections to the control plane from being established.A continuously increasing number of connections shown by:user@host > show system connectionsis indicative of the problem. To recover the respective RE needs to be restarted manually.This issue only affects IPv4 but does not affect IPv6.This issue only affects TCP sessions established in-band (over an interface on an FPC) but not out-of-band (over the management ethernet port on the routing-engine).This issue affects Junos OS Evolved:   *  All versions before 21.4R3-S9-EVO,  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S4-EVO,  *  22.4 version before 22.4R3-S3-EVO,  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2-S1-EVO,  *  23.4 versions before 23.4R2-EVO. | [1]https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA88132 |

The btcd Bitcoin client (versions 0.10 to 0.24) did not correctly re-implement Bitcoin Core`s "FindAndDelete()" functionality. This logic is consensus-critical: the difference in behavior with the other Bitcoin clients can lead to btcd clients accepting an invalid Bitcoin block (or rejecting a valid one). This consensus failure can be leveraged to cause a chain split (accepting an invalid Bitcoin block) or be exploited to DoS the btcd nodes (rejecting a valid Bitcoin block). An attacker can create a standard transaction where FindAndDelete doesn`t return a match but removeOpCodeByData does making btcd get a different sighash, leading to a chain split. Importantly, this vulnerability can be exploited remotely by any Bitcoin user and does not require any hash power. This is because the difference in behavior can be triggered by a "standard" Bitcoin transaction, that is a transaction which gets relayed through the P2P network before it gets included in a Bitcoin block. `removeOpcodeByData(script []byte, dataToRemove []byte)` removes any data pushes from `script` that contain `dataToRemove`. However, `FindAndDelete` only removes exact matches. So for example, with `script = "<data> <data||foo>"` and `dataToRemove = "data"` btcd will remove both data pushes but Bitcoin Core`s `FindAndDelete` only removes the first `<data>` push. This has been patched in btcd version v0.24.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue. | [1]https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/cve-2024-38365-public-disclosure-btcd-findanddelete-bug/1184<br>[2]https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/commit/04469e600e7d4a58881e2e5447d19024e49800f5<br>[3]https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/releases/tag/v0.24.2<br>[4]https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/security/advisories/GHSA-27vh-h6mc-q6g8 |
