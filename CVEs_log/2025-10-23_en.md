| 29 | CVE-2025-62525 | 7.9  | HIGH | OpenWrt Project is a Linux operating system targeting embedded devices. Prior to version 24.10.4, local users could read and write arbitrary kernel memory using the ioctls of the ltq-ptm driver which is used to drive the datapath of the DSL line. This only effects the lantiq target supporting xrx200, danube and amazon SoCs from Lantiq/Intel/MaxLinear with the DSL in PTM mode. The DSL driver for the VRX518 is not affected. ATM mode is also not affected. Most VDSL lines use PTM mode and most ADSL lines use ATM mode. OpenWrt is normally running as a single user system, but some services are sandboxed. This vulnerability could allow attackers to escape a ujail sandbox or other contains. This is fixed in OpenWrt 24.10.4. There are no workarounds. | [1]https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/commit/2a76abc5442e3f74d95b4caa9bb57e5488fc132e<br>[2]https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/commit/e001b31163a77683ee741d169f794cfa50926f37<br>[3]https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/security/advisories/GHSA-h427-frpr-7cqr<br>[4]https://openwrt.org/advisory/2025-10-22-2 |
| 30 | CVE-2025-62526 | 7.9  | HIGH | OpenWrt Project is a Linux operating system targeting embedded devices. Prior to version 24.10.4, ubusd contains a heap buffer overflow in the event registration parsing code. This allows an attacker to modify the head and potentially execute arbitrary code in the context of the ubus daemon. The affected code is executed before running the ACL checks, all ubus clients are able to send such messages. In addition to the heap corruption, the crafted subscription also results in a bypass of the listen ACL. This is fixed in OpenWrt 24.10.4. There are no workarounds. | [1]https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/commit/4b907e69ea58fc0ba35fd1755dc4ba22262af3a4<br>[2]https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/commit/a7901969932a175cded3c93bdeb65f32ed3705e6<br>[3]https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/security/advisories/GHSA-cp32-65v4-cp73<br>[4]https://github.com/openwrt/ubus/commit/60e04048a0e2f3e33651c19e62861b41be4c290f<br>[5]https://github.com/openwrt/ubus/commit/aa4a7ee1d3417bc11207ad0a78d579ece7fe0c13<br>[6]https://github.com/openwrt/ubus/commit/d31effb4277bd557f5ccf16d909422718c1e49d0<br>[7]https://openwrt.org/advisory/2025-10-22-1 |

| 36 | CVE-2025-62610 | 8.1  | HIGH | Hono is a Web application framework that provides support for any JavaScript runtime. In versions from 1.1.0 to before 4.10.2, Hono’s JWT Auth Middleware does not provide a built-in aud (Audience) verification option, which can cause confused-deputy / token-mix-up issues: an API may accept a valid token that was issued for a different audience (e.g., another service) when multiple services share the same issuer/keys. This can lead to unintended cross-service access. Hono’s docs list verification options for iss/nbf/iat/exp only, with no aud support; RFC 7519 requires that when an aud claim is present, tokens MUST be rejected unless the processing party identifies itself in that claim. This issue has been patched in version 4.10.2. | [1]https://github.com/honojs/hono/commit/45ba3bf9e3dff8e4bd85d6b47d4b71c8d6c66bef<br>[2]https://github.com/honojs/hono/security/advisories/GHSA-m732-5p4w-x69g |
