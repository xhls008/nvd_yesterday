| 19 | CVE-2025-68616 | 7.5  | HIGH | WeasyPrint helps web developers to create PDF documents. Prior to version 68.0, a server-side request forgery (SSRF) protection bypass exists in WeasyPrint`s `default_url_fetcher`. The vulnerability allows attackers to access internal network resources (such as `localhost` services or cloud metadata endpoints) even when a developer has implemented a custom `url_fetcher` to block such access. This occurs because the underlying `urllib` library follows HTTP redirects automatically without re-validating the new destination against the developer`s security policy. Version 68.0 contains a patch for the issue. | [1]https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/commit/b6a14f0f3f4ce9c0c75c1a2d73cb1c5d43f0e565<br>[2]https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/security/advisories/GHSA-983w-rhvv-gwmv |

| 21 | CVE-2026-22031 | 8.4  | HIGH | @fastify/middie is the plugin that adds middleware support on steroids to Fastify. A security vulnerability exists in @fastify/middie prior to version 9.1.0 where middleware registered with a specific path prefix can be bypassed using URL-encoded characters (e.g., `/%61dmin` instead of `/admin`). While the middleware engine fails to match the encoded path and skips execution, the underlying Fastify router correctly decodes the path and matches the route handler, allowing attackers to access protected endpoints without the middleware constraints. Version 9.1.0 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/fastify/middie/commit/d44cd56eb724490babf7b452fdbbdd37ea2effba<br>[2]https://github.com/fastify/middie/pull/245<br>[3]https://github.com/fastify/middie/releases/tag/v9.1.0<br>[4]https://github.com/fastify/middie/security/advisories/GHSA-cxrg-g7r8-w69p |

| 23 | CVE-2026-22037 | 8.4  | HIGH | The @fastify/express plugin adds full Express compatibility to Fastify. A security vulnerability exists in @fastify/express prior to version 4.0.3 where middleware registered with a specific path prefix can be bypassed using URL-encoded characters (e.g., `/%61dmin` instead of `/admin`). While the middleware engine fails to match the encoded path and skips execution, the underlying Fastify router correctly decodes the path and matches the route handler, allowing attackers to access protected endpoints without the middleware constraints. The vulnerability is caused by how @fastify/express matches requests against registered middleware paths. This vulnerability is similar to, but differs from, CVE-2026-22031 because this is a different npm module with its own code. Version 4.0.3 of @fastify/express contains a patch fort the issue. | [1]https://github.com/fastify/fastify-express/commit/dc02a3fe1387f945143f22597baa42557d549a40<br>[2]https://github.com/fastify/fastify-express/security/advisories/GHSA-g6q3-96cp-5r5m |
| 24 | CVE-2026-22850 | 8.3  | HIGH | Koko Analytics is an open-source analytics plugin for WordPress. Versions prior to 2.1.3 are vulnerable to arbitrary SQL execution through unescaped analytics export/import and permissive admin SQL import. Unauthenticated visitors can submit arbitrary path (`pa`) and referrer (`r`) values to the public tracking endpoint in src/Resources/functions/collect.php, which stores those strings verbatim in the analytics tables. The admin export logic in src/Admin/Data_Export.php writes these stored values directly into SQL INSERT statements without escaping. A crafted path such as "),(`999`,`x`);DROP TABLE wp_users;-- breaks out of the value list. When an administrator later imports that export file, the import handler in src/Admin/Data_Import.php reads the uploaded SQL with file_get_contents, performs only a superficial header check, splits on semicolons, and executes each statement via $wpdb->query with no validation of table names or statement types. Additionally, any authenticated user with manage_koko_analytics can upload an arbitrary .sql file and have it executed in the same permissive way. Combined, attacker-controlled input flows from the tracking endpoint into exported SQL and through the import execution sink, or directly via malicious uploads, enabling arbitrary SQL execution. In a worst-case scenario, attackers can achieve arbitrary SQL execution on the WordPress database, allowing deletion of core tables (e.g., wp_users), insertion of backdoor administrator accounts, or other destructive/privilege-escalating actions. Version 2.1.3 patches the issue. | [1]https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HdQKf42prwrBUUG2CwbIkccTp2i6HR6d/view?usp=sharing<br>[2]https://github.com/ibericode/koko-analytics/commit/7b7d58f4a1838c8203cf4e7bb59847c982432119<br>[3]https://github.com/ibericode/koko-analytics/security/advisories/GHSA-jgfh-264m-xh3q |
| 25 | CVE-2026-22797 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | An issue was discovered in OpenStack keystonemiddleware 10.5 through 10.7 before 10.7.2, 10.8 and 10.9 before 10.9.1, and 10.10 through 10.12 before 10.12.1. The external_oauth2_token middleware fails to sanitize incoming authentication headers before processing OAuth 2.0 tokens. By sending forged identity headers such as X-Is-Admin-Project, X-Roles, or X-User-Id, an authenticated attacker may escalate privileges or impersonate other users. All deployments using the external_oauth2_token middleware are affected. | [1]https://launchpad.net/bugs/2129018<br>[2]https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2026/01/16/9<br>[3]http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2026/01/15/1<br>[4]http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2026/01/16/2<br>[5]http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2026/01/16/3<br>[6]http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2026/01/16/9 |
| 26 | CVE-2026-23625 | 8.7  | HIGH | OpenProject is an open-source, web-based project management software. Versions 16.3.0 through 16.6.4 are affected by a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Roadmap view. OpenProject’s roadmap view renders the “Related work packages” list for each version. When a version contains work packages from a different project (e.g., a subproject), the helper link_to_work_package prepends package.project.to_s to the link and returns the entire string with .html_safe. Because project names are user-controlled and no escaping happens before calling html_safe, any HTML placed in a subproject name is injected verbatim into the page. The underlying issue is mitigated in versions 16.6.5 and 17.0.0 by setting a `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header, which was in place until a refactoring move to Rails standard content-security policy, which did not properly apply this header in the new configuration since OpenProject 16.3.0. Those who cannot upgrade their installations should ensure that they add a X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header in their proxying web application server. | [1]https://github.com/opf/openproject/releases/tag/v16.6.5<br>[2]https://github.com/opf/openproject/releases/tag/v17.0.0<br>[3]https://github.com/opf/openproject/security/advisories/GHSA-cvpq-cc56-gwxx |

In versions prior to 1.16.1, the password authentication mechanism transmits passwords via URL query parameters instead of the HTTP request body. This causes passwords to be logged in server access logs and potentially exposed through browser history, Referer headers, and proxy logs. Version 1.16.1 patches the issue. | [1]https://github.com/Quenary/tugtainer/commit/9d23bf40ac1d39005582abfcf0a84753a4e29d52<br>[2]https://github.com/Quenary/tugtainer/security/advisories/GHSA-f2qf-f544-xm4p |

| 35 | CVE-2026-23837 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | MyTube is a self-hosted downloader and player for several video websites. A vulnerability present in version 1.7.65 and poetntially earlier versions allows unauthenticated users to bypass the mandatory authentication check in the roleBasedAuthMiddleware. By simply not providing an authentication cookie (making req.user undefined), a request is incorrectly passed through to downstream handlers. All users running MyTube with loginEnabled: true are impacted. This flaw allows an attacker to access and modify application settings via /api/settings, change administrative and visitor passwords, and access other protected routes that rely on this specific middleware. The problem is patched in v1.7.66. MyTube maintainers recommend all users upgrade to at least version v1.7.64 immediately to secure their instances. The fix ensures that the middleware explicitly blocks requests if a user is not authenticated, rather than defaulting to next(). Those who cannot upgrade immediately can mitigate risk by restricting network access by usi a firewall or reverse proxy (like Nginx) to restrict access to the /api/ endpoints to trusted IP addresses only or, if they are comfortable editing the source code, manually patch by locating roleBasedAuthMiddleware and ensuring that the logic defaults to an error (401 Unauthorized) when req.user is undefined, instead of calling next(). | [1]https://github.com/franklioxygen/MyTube/commit/f85ae9b0d6e4a6480c6af5b675a99069d08d496e<br>[2]https://github.com/franklioxygen/MyTube/security/advisories/GHSA-cmvj-g69f-8664 |
