| 7 | CVE-2024-21545 | 8.2  | HIGH | Proxmox Virtual Environment is an open-source server management platform for enterprise virtualization. Insufficient safeguards against malicious API response values allow authenticated attackers with `Sys.Audit` or `VM.Monitor` privileges to download arbitrary host files via the API.When handling the result from a request handler before returning it to the user, the handle_api2_request function will check for the ‘download’ or ‘data’->’download’ objects inside the request handler call response object. If present, handle_api2_request will read a local file defined by this object and return it to the user.Two endpoints were identified which can control the object returned by a request handler sufficiently that the ’download’ object is defined and user controlled. This results in arbitrary file read.The privileges of this file read can result in full compromise of the system by various impacts such as disclosing sensitive files allowing for privileged session forgery. | [1]https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/proxmox-virtual-environment-security-advisories.149331/post-705345<br>[2]https://git.proxmox.com/?p=pve-http-server.git;a=blob;f=src/PVE/APIServer/AnyEvent.pm;h=a8d60c18102d2eea9235720852fb60d90f405d0a;hb=HEAD#l988 |

These are typically usedfor platform tasks such as legacy USB emulation.Since the precise purpose of these regions is unknown, once a deviceassociated with such a region is active, the mappings of these regionsneed to remain continuouly accessible by the device.  In the logicestablishing these mappings, error handling was flawed, resulting insuch mappings to potentially remain in place when they should have beenremoved again.  Respective guests would then gain access to memoryregions which they aren`t supposed to have access to. | [1]https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-460.html |
| 49 | CVE-2024-31146 | 7.5  | HIGH | When multiple devices share resources and one of them is to be passedthrough to a guest, security of the entire system and of respectiveguests individually cannot really be guaranteed without knowinginternals of any of the involved guests.  Therefore such a configurationcannot really be security-supported, yet making that explicit was so farmissing.Resources the sharing of which is known to be problematic include, butare not limited to- - PCI Base Address Registers (BARs) of multiple devices mapping to the  same page (4k on x86),- - INTx lines. | [1]https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-461.html |

| 55 | CVE-2024-45613 | 7.2  | HIGH | CKEditor 5 is a JavaScript rich-text editor. Starting in version 40.0.0 and prior to version 43.1.1, a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present in the CKEditor 5 clipboard package. This vulnerability could be triggered by a specific user action, leading to unauthorized JavaScript code execution, if the attacker managed to insert a malicious content into the editor, which might happen with a very specific editor configuration. This vulnerability only affects installations where the Block Toolbar plugin is enabled and either the General HTML Support (with a configuration that permits unsafe markup) or the HTML Embed plugin is also enabled. A fix for the problem is available in version 43.1.1. As a workaround, one may disable the block toolbar plugin. | [1]https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/releases/tag/v43.1.1<br>[2]https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/security/advisories/GHSA-rgg8-g5x8-wr9v |
