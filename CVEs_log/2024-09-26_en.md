| 1 | CVE-2024-7617 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Contact Form to Any API plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Contact Form 7 form fields in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/contact-form-to-any-api/trunk/admin/partials/cf7-to-any-api-admin-entries.php<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/39487908-5cc5-42ac-8af4-65626694b1e4?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2024-8349 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Uncanny Groups for LearnDash plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 6.1.0.1. This is due to the plugin not properly restricting what users a group leader can edit. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with group leader-level access and above, to change admin account email addresses which can subsequently lead to admin account access. | [1]https://github.com/karlemilnikka/CVE-2024-8349-and-CVE-2024-8350<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/64cf0ae2-8d66-40d1-8bb6-0cab1dafab0d?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2024-8481 | 7.3  | HIGH | The The Special Text Boxes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 6.2.2. This is due to the plugin adding the filter add_filter(`comment_text`, `do_shortcode`); which will run all shortcodes in comments.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/rest-api-to-miniprogram/tags/4.7.0/includes/api/ram-rest-comments-controller.php#L247<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6e0945eb-ceec-4536-822a-fe864c21b580?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2024-8485 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The REST API TO MiniProgram plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeovr in all versions up to, and including, 4.7.1 via the updateUserInfo() due to missing validation on the `openid` user controlled key that determines what user will be updated. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary user`s accounts, including their email to a @weixin.com email, which can the be leveraged to reset the password of the user`s account, including administrators. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/rest-api-to-miniprogram/tags/4.7.0/includes/api/ram-rest-weixin-controller.php#L264<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b53066d3-2ff3-4460-896a-facd77455914?source=cve |

| 12 | CVE-2024-31145 | 7.5  | HIGH | Certain PCI devices in a system might be assigned Reserved MemoryRegions (specified via Reserved Memory Region Reporting, "RMRR") forIntel VT-d or Unity Mapping ranges for AMD-Vi.  These are typically usedfor platform tasks such as legacy USB emulation.Since the precise purpose of these regions is unknown, once a deviceassociated with such a region is active, the mappings of these regionsneed to remain continuouly accessible by the device.  In the logicestablishing these mappings, error handling was flawed, resulting insuch mappings to potentially remain in place when they should have beenremoved again.  Respective guests would then gain access to memoryregions which they aren`t supposed to have access to. | [1]https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-460.html |
| 13 | CVE-2024-31146 | 7.5  | HIGH | When multiple devices share resources and one of them is to be passedthrough to a guest, security of the entire system and of respectiveguests individually cannot really be guaranteed without knowinginternals of any of the involved guests.  Therefore such a configurationcannot really be security-supported, yet making that explicit was so farmissing.Resources the sharing of which is known to be problematic include, butare not limited to- - PCI Base Address Registers (BARs) of multiple devices mapping to the  same page (4k on x86),- - INTx lines. | [1]https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-461.html |

| 19 | CVE-2024-45613 | 7.2  | HIGH | CKEditor 5 is a JavaScript rich-text editor. Starting in version 40.0.0 and prior to version 43.1.1, a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present in the CKEditor 5 clipboard package. This vulnerability could be triggered by a specific user action, leading to unauthorized JavaScript code execution, if the attacker managed to insert a malicious content into the editor, which might happen with a very specific editor configuration. This vulnerability only affects installations where the Block Toolbar plugin is enabled and either the General HTML Support (with a configuration that permits unsafe markup) or the HTML Embed plugin is also enabled. A fix for the problem is available in version 43.1.1. As a workaround, one may disable the block toolbar plugin. | [1]https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/releases/tag/v43.1.1<br>[2]https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/security/advisories/GHSA-rgg8-g5x8-wr9v |
