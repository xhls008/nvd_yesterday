| 1 | CVE-2024-8353 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | The GiveWP â€“ Donation Plugin and Fundraising Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.16.1 via deserialization of untrusted input via several parameters like `give_title` and `card_address`. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain allows attackers to delete arbitrary files and achieve remote code execution. This is essentially the same vulnerability as CVE-2024-5932, however, it was discovered the the presence of stripslashes_deep on user_info allows the is_serialized check to be bypassed. This issue was mostly patched in 3.16.1, but further hardening was added in 3.16.2. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/give/tags/3.16.0/includes/process-donation.php#L154<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3149290/give/tags/3.16.1/includes/admin/admin-actions.php<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3149290/give/tags/3.16.1/includes/process-donation.php<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3149290/give/tags/3.16.1/src/Helpers/Utils.php<br>[5]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3157829/give/tags/3.16.2/includes/process-donation.php<br>[6]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c4c530fa-eaf4-4721-bfb6-9fc06d7f343c?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2024-23938 | 8.8  | HIGH | Silicon Labs Gecko OS Debug Interface Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Silicon Labs Gecko OS. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.The specific flaw exists within the debug interface. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device.Was ZDI-CAN-23184 | [1]https://community.silabs.com/a45Vm0000000Atp<br>[2]https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-24-868/ |
| 3 | CVE-2024-23957 | 8.8  | HIGH | Autel MaxiCharger AC Elite Business C50 DLB_HostHeartBeat Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Autel MaxiCharger AC Elite Business C50 charging stations. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.The specific flaw exists within the DLB_HostHeartBeat handler of the DLB protocol implementation. When parsing an AES key, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device.Was ZDI-CAN-23241 | [1]https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-24-854/ |
| 4 | CVE-2024-23923 | 8.8  | HIGH | Alpine Halo9 prh_l2_sar_data_ind Use-After-Free Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Alpine Halo9 devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.The specific flaw exists within the prh_l2_sar_data_ind function. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.Was ZDI-CAN-22945 | [1]https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-24-844/ |
| 5 | CVE-2024-23935 | 8.0  | HIGH | Alpine Halo9 DecodeUTF7 Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Alpine Halo9 devices. An attacker must first obtain the ability to pair a malicious Bluetooth device with the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.The specific flaw exists within the DecodeUTF7 function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.Was ZDI-CAN-23249 | [1]https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-24-848/ |
| 6 | CVE-2024-23959 | 8.0  | HIGH | Autel MaxiCharger AC Elite Business C50 BLE AppChargingControl Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Autel MaxiCharger AC Elite Business C50 charging stations. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.The specific flaw exists within the handling of the AppChargingControl BLE command. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer.
