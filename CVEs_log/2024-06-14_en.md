| 22 | CVE-2024-37164 | 7.1  | HIGH | Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) is an interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision. CVAT allows users to supply custom endpoint URLs for cloud storages based on Amazon S3 and Azure Blob Storage. Starting in version 2.1.0 and prior to version 2.14.3, an attacker with a CVAT account can exploit this feature by specifying URLs whose host part is an intranet IP address or an internal domain name. By doing this, the attacker may be able to probe the network that the CVAT backend runs in for HTTP(S) servers. In addition, if there is a web server on this network that is sufficiently API-compatible with an Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage endpoint, and either allows anonymous access, or allows authentication with credentials that are known by the attacker, then the attacker may be able to create a cloud storage linked to this server. They may then be able to list files on the server; extract files from the server, if these files are of a type that CVAT supports reading from cloud storage (media data (such as images/videos/archives), importable annotations or datasets, task/project backups); and/or overwrite files on this server with exported annotations/datasets/backups. The exact capabilities of the attacker will depend on how the internal server is configured. Users should upgrade to CVAT 2.14.3 to receive a patch. In this release, the existing SSRF mitigation measures are applied to requests to cloud providers, with access to intranet IP addresses prohibited by default. Some workarounds are also available. One may use network security solutions such as virtual networks or firewalls to prohibit network access from the CVAT backend to unrelated servers on your internal network and/or require authentication for access to internal servers. | [1]https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/commit/f2346934c80bd91740f55c2788ef7d535a291d4c<br>[2]https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/security/advisories/GHSA-q684-4jjh-83g6 |
| 23 | CVE-2024-37306 | 7.1  | HIGH | Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) is an interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision. Starting in version 2.2.0 and prior to version 2.14.3, if an attacker can trick a logged-in CVAT user into visiting a malicious URL, they can initiate a dataset export or a backup from a project, task or job that the victim user has permission to export into a cloud storage that the victim user has access to. The name of the resulting file can be chosen by the attacker. This implies that the attacker can overwrite arbitrary files in any cloud storage that the victim can access and, if the attacker has read access to the cloud storage used in the attack, they can obtain media files, annotations, settings and other information from any projects, tasks or jobs that the victim has permission to export. Version 2.14.3 contains a fix for the issue. No known workarounds are available. | [1]https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/commit/5d36d10e493d92e893d7eae595544bcbe9cce1ce<br>[2]https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/security/advisories/GHSA-jpf9-646h-4px7 |
| 24 | CVE-2024-37307 | 7.9  | HIGH | Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. Starting in version 1.13.0 and prior to versions 1.13.7, 1.14.12, and 1.15.6, the output of `cilium-bugtool` can contain sensitive data when the tool is run (with the `--envoy-dump` flag set) against Cilium deployments with the Envoy proxy enabled. Users of the TLS inspection, Ingress with TLS termination, Gateway API with TLS termination, and Kafka network policies with API key filtering features are affected. The sensitive data includes the CA certificate, certificate chain, and private key used by Cilium HTTP Network Policies, and when using Ingress/Gateway API and the API keys used in Kafka-related network policy. `cilium-bugtool` is a debugging tool that is typically invoked manually and does not run during the normal operation of a Cilium cluster. This issue has been patched in Cilium v1.15.6, v1.14.12, and v1.13.17. There is no workaround to this issue. | [1]https://github.com/cilium/cilium/commit/0191b1ebcfdd61cefd06da0315a0e7d504167407<br>[2]https://github.com/cilium/cilium/commit/224e288a5bf40d0bb0f16c9413693b319633431a<br>[3]https://github.com/cilium/cilium/commit/9299c0fd0024e33397cffc666ff851e82af28741<br>[4]https://github.com/cilium/cilium/commit/958d7b77274bf2c272d8cdfd812631d644250653<br>[5]https://github.com/cilium/cilium/commit/9eb25ba40391a9b035d7e66401b862818f4aac4b<br>[6]https://github.com/cilium/cilium/commit/bf9a1ae1b2d2b2c9cca329d7aa96aa4858032a61<br>[7]https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-wh78-7948-358j |
