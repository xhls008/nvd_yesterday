| 31 | CVE-2025-30223 | 9.3  | CRITICAL | Beego is an open-source web framework for the Go programming language. Prior to 2.3.6, a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Beego`s RenderForm() function due to improper HTML escaping of user-controlled data. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in victims` browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, credential theft, or account takeover. The vulnerability affects any application using Beego`s RenderForm() function with user-provided data. Since it is a high-level function generating an entire form markup, many developers would assume it automatically escapes attributes (the way most frameworks do). This vulnerability is fixed in 2.3.6. | [1]https://github.com/beego/beego/commit/939bb18c66406466715ddadd25dd9ffa6f169e25<br>[2]https://github.com/beego/beego/security/advisories/GHSA-2j42-h78h-q4fg |

| 34 | CVE-2025-21893 | 7.8  | HIGH | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:keys: Fix UAF in key_put()Once a key`s reference count has been reduced to 0, the garbage collectorthread may destroy it at any time and so key_put() is not allowed to touchthe key after that point.  The most key_put() is normally allowed to do isto touch key_gc_work as that`s a static global variable.However, in an effort to speed up the reclamation of quota, this is nowdone in key_put() once the key`s usage is reduced to 0 - but now the codeis looking at the key after the deadline, which is forbidden.Fix this by using a flag to indicate that a key can be gc`d now rather thanlooking at the key`s refcount in the garbage collector. | [1]https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6afe2ea2daec156bd94ad2c5a6f4f4c48240dcd3<br>[2]https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/75845c6c1a64483e9985302793dbf0dfa5f71e32<br>[3]https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f6a3cf833188e897c97028cd7b926e3f2cb1a8c0 |
