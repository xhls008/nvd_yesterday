| 1 | CVE-2025-2106 | 7.5  | HIGH | The ArielBrailovsky-ViralAd plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the `text` and `id` parameters of the limpia() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.8 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. This only appears to be exploitable on very old versions of WordPress. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/arielbrailovsky-viralad/trunk/inc/anuncio.php#L174<br>[2]https://wordpress.org/plugins/arielbrailovsky-viralad/<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/60cd2178-858e-4e24-8967-13b04f675d2d?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2025-2107 | 7.5  | HIGH | The ArielBrailovsky-ViralAd plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the `id` parameter of the printResultAndDie() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.8 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

| 4 | CVE-2025-1119 | 7.3  | HIGH | The Appointment Booking Calendar — Simply Schedule Appointments Booking Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.8.5. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3250719/simply-schedule-appointments/trunk/booking-app-new/page-appointment-edit.php<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/1be557db-daa8-4d86-819a-462f29da884b?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2025-2271 | 7.7  | HIGH | A vulnerability exists in Issuetrak v17.2.2 and prior that allows a low-privileged user to access audit results of other users by exploiting an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in the Issuetrak audit component. The vulnerability enables unauthorized access to sensitive information, including user details, network and hardware information, installed programs, running processes, drives, and printers. Due to improper access controls, an attacker can retrieve audit data belonging to other users, potentially leading to unauthorized data exposure, privacy violations, and security risks. | [1]https://helpcenter.issuetrak.com/home/2340-issuetrak-release-notes |
| 6 | CVE-2025-25175 | 7.8  | HIGH | A vulnerability has been identified in Simcenter Femap V2401 (All versions < V2401.0003), Simcenter Femap V2406 (All versions < V2406.0002). The affected application contains a memory corruption vulnerability while  parsing specially crafted .NEU files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.

| 7 | CVE-2024-10942 | 7.5  | HIGH | The All-in-One WP Migration and Backup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 7.89 via deserialization of untrusted input in the `replace_serialized_values` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. An administrator must export and restore a backup in order to trigger the exploit. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/all-in-one-wp-migration/trunk/lib/vendor/servmask/database/class-ai1wm-database-utility.php#L97<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3253940/<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0823d1d9-4f3b-4ac0-8cd1-ad208ebc325f?source=cve |
