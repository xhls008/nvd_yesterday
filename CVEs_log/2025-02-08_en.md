| 1 | CVE-2025-0674 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Multiple Elber products are affected by an authentication bypass vulnerability which allows unauthorized access to the password management functionality. Attackers can exploit this issue by manipulating the endpoint to overwrite any user`s password within the system. This grants them unauthorized administrative access to protected areas of the application, compromising the device`s system security. | [1]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-25-035-03 |
| 2 | CVE-2025-0675 | 7.5  | HIGH | Multiple Elber products suffer from an unauthenticated device configuration and client-side hidden functionality disclosure. | [1]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-25-035-03 |
| 3 | CVE-2025-1061 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Nextend Social Login Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 3.1.16.

| 50 | CVE-2025-24366 | 7.5  | HIGH | SFTPGo is an open source, event-driven file transfer solution. SFTPGo supports execution of a defined set of commands via SSH. Besides a set of default commands some optional commands can be activated, one of them being `rsync`. It is disabled in the default configuration and it is limited to the local filesystem, it does not work with cloud/remote storage backends. Due to missing sanitization of the client provided `rsync` command, an authenticated remote user can use some options of the rsync command to read or write files with the permissions of the SFTPGo server process. This issue was fixed in version v2.6.5 by checking the client provided arguments. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/commit/b347ab6051f6c501da205c09315fe99cd1fa3ba1<br>[2]https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/security/advisories/GHSA-vj7w-3m8c-6vpx |
| 51 | CVE-2025-24028 | 7.8  | HIGH | Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. This vulnerability is caused by differences between how Joplin`s HTML sanitizer handles comments and how the browser handles comments. This affects both the Rich Text Editor and the Markdown viewer. However, unlike the Rich Text Editor, the Markdown viewer is `cross-origin isolated`, which prevents JavaScript from directly accessing functions/variables in the toplevel Joplin `window`. This issue is not present in Joplin 3.1.24 and may have been introduced in `9b50539`. This is an XSS vulnerability that impacts users that open untrusted notes in the Rich Text Editor. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 3.2.12 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/commit/2a058ed8097c2502e152b26394dc1917897f5817<br>[2]https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/commit/9b505395918bc923f34fe6f3b960bb10e8cf234e<br>[3]https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/security/advisories/GHSA-5w3c-wph9-hq92<br>[4]https://joplinapp.org/help/dev/spec/note_viewer_isolation |
| 52 | CVE-2025-25187 | 7.8  | HIGH | Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. This vulnerability is caused by adding note titles to the document using React`s `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, without first escaping HTML entities. Joplin lacks a Content-Security-Policy with a restrictive `script-src`. This allows arbitrary JavaScript execution via inline `onclick`/`onload` event handlers in unsanitized HTML. Additionally, Joplin`s main window is created with `nodeIntegration` set to `true`, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution to result in arbitrary code execution. Anyone who 1) receives notes from unknown sources and 2) uses <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>p</kbd> to search is impacted. This issue has been addressed in version 3.1.24 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src<br>[2]https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/2fc9bd476b0d9abcddb0a46f615a48333779d225/packages/app-desktop/plugins/GotoAnything.tsx#L558<br>[3]https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/commit/360ece6f8873ef81afbfb98b25faad696ffccdb6<br>[4]https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/security/advisories/GHSA-9gfv-q6wj-fr3c |
