| 21 | CVE-2026-23864 | 7.5  | HIGH | Multiple denial of service vulnerabilities exist in React Server Components, affecting the following packages: react-server-dom-parcel, react-server-dom-turbopack, react-server-dom-webpack.The vulnerabilities are triggered by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to Server Function endpoints, and could lead to server crashes, out-of-memory exceptions or excessive CPU usage; depending on the vulnerable code path being exercised, the application configuration and application code.Strongly consider upgrading to the latest package versions to reduce risk and prevent availability issues in applications using React Server Components. | [1]https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2026-23864 |
| 22 | CVE-2026-22709 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | vm2 is an open source vm/sandbox for Node.js. In vm2 prior to version 3.10.2, `Promise.prototype.then` `Promise.prototype.catch` callback sanitization can be bypassed. This allows attackers to escape the sandbox and run arbitrary code. In lib/setup-sandbox.js, the callback function of `localPromise.prototype.then` is sanitized, but `globalPromise.prototype.then` is not sanitized. The return value of async functions is `globalPromise` object. Version 3.10.2 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/commit/4b009c2d4b1131c01810c1205e641d614c322a29<br>[2]https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/releases/tag/v3.10.2<br>[3]https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/security/advisories/GHSA-99p7-6v5w-7xg8 |
| 23 | CVE-2026-24123 | 7.4  | HIGH | BentoML is a Python library for building online serving systems optimized for AI apps and model inference. Prior to version 1.4.34, BentoML`s `bentofile.yaml` configuration allows path traversal attacks through multiple file path fields (`description`, `docker.setup_script`, `docker.dockerfile_template`, `conda.environment_yml`). An attacker can craft a malicious bentofile that, when built by a victim, exfiltrates arbitrary files from the filesystem into the bento archive. This enables supply chain attacks where sensitive files (SSH keys, credentials, environment variables) are silently embedded in bentos and exposed when pushed to registries or deployed. Version 1.4.34 contains a patch for the issue. | [1]https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/commit/84d08cfeb40c5f2ce71b3d3444bbaa0fb16b5ca4<br>[2]https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/releases/tag/v1.4.34<br>[3]https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/security/advisories/GHSA-6r62-w2q3-48hf |
| 24 | CVE-2026-24470 | 8.1  | HIGH | Skipper is an HTTP router and reverse proxy for service composition. Prior to version 0.24.0, when running Skipper as an Ingress controller, users with permissions to create an Ingress and a Service of type ExternalName can create routes that enable them to use Skipper`s network access to reach internal services. Version 0.24.0 disables Kubernetes ExternalName by default. As a workaround, developers can allow list targets of an ExternalName and allow list via regular expressions. | [1]https://github.com/zalando/skipper/commit/a4c87ce029a58eb8e1c2c1f93049194a39cf6219<br>[2]https://github.com/zalando/skipper/security/advisories/GHSA-mxxc-p822-2hx9<br>[3]https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#externalname |
