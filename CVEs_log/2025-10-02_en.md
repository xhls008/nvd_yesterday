| 1 | CVE-2020-36852 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | The Custom Searchable Data Entry System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated database wiping in versions up to, and including 1.7.1, due to a missing capability check and lack of sufficient validation on the ghazale_sds_delete_entries_table_row() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to completely wipe database tables such as wp_users. | [1]https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2020/03/active-attack-on-zero-day-in-custom-searchable-data-entry-system-plugin/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/245d89e5-52cc-44b1-a858-0ca0aacb4e26?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2025-61622 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Deserialization of untrusted data in python in pyfory versions 0.12.0 through 0.12.2, or the legacy pyfury versions from 0.1.0 through 0.10.3: allows arbitrary code execution. An application is vulnerable if it reads pyfory serialized data from untrusted sources. An attacker can craft a data stream that selects pickle-fallback serializer during deserialization, leading to the execution of `pickle.loads`, which is vulnerable to remote code execution.Users are recommended to upgrade to pyfory version 0.12.3 or later, which has removed pickle fallback serializer and thus fixes this issue. | [1]https://lists.apache.org/thread/vfn9hp9qt06db5yo1gmj3l114o3o2csd |

| 16 | CVE-2025-59147 | 7.5  | HIGH | Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open Information Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. Versions 7.0.11 and below, as well as 8.0.0, are vulnerable to detection bypass when crafted traffic sends multiple SYN packets with different sequence numbers within the same flow tuple, which can cause Suricata to fail to pick up the TCP session. In IDS mode this can lead to a detection and logging bypass. In IPS mode this will lead to the flow getting blocked. This issue is fixed in versions 7.0.12 and 8.0.1. | [1]https://forum.suricata.io/t/suricata-8-0-1-and-7-0-12-released/6018<br>[2]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/be6315dba0d9101b11d16e9dacfe2822b3792f1b<br>[3]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/e91b03c90385db15e21cf1a0e85b921bf92b039e<br>[4]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-v8hv-6v7x-4c2r |
| 17 | CVE-2025-59148 | 7.5  | HIGH | Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open Information Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. Versions 8.0.0 and below incorrectly handle the entropy keyword when not anchored to a "sticky" buffer, which can lead to a segmentation fault. This issue is fixed in version 8.0.1. To workaround this issue, users can disable rules using the entropy keyword, or validate they are anchored to a sticky buffer. | [1]https://forum.suricata.io/t/suricata-8-0-1-and-7-0-12-released/6018<br>[2]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/9f32550e18f97ea5d610dd7c36aab0ba142c096c<br>[3]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-5qf6-92xg-3rr3<br>[4]https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/7838 |
| 18 | CVE-2025-59150 | 7.5  | HIGH | Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open Information Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. Version 8.0.0`s usage of the tls.subjectaltname keyword can lead to a segmentation fault when the decoded subjectaltname contains a NULL byte. This issue is fixed in version 8.0.1. To workaround this issue, disable rules using the tls.subjectaltname keyword. | [1]https://forum.suricata.io/t/suricata-8-0-1-and-7-0-12-released/6018<br>[2]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/d590fdfe42e995fd558315f0c24f9a352e21479d<br>[3]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-mhv7-qfmj-m3f3<br>[4]https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/7881 |
| 19 | CVE-2025-59531 | 7.5  | HIGH | Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Versions 1.2.0 through 1.8.7, 2.0.0-rc1 through 2.14.19, 3.0.0-rc1 through 3.2.0-rc1, 3.1.7 and 3.0.18 are vulnerable to malicious API requests which can crash the API server and cause denial of service to legitimate clients. Without a configured webhook.bitbucketserver.secret, Argo CD`s /api/webhook endpoint crashes when receiving a malformed Bitbucket Server payload (non-array repository.links.clone field). A single unauthenticated request triggers CrashLoopBackOff, and targeting all replicas causes complete API outage. This issue is fixed in versions 2.14.20, 3.2.0-rc2, 3.1.8 and 3.0.19. | [1]https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/5c466a4e39802e059e75c0008ae7b7b8e842538f<br>[2]https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-f9gq-prrc-hrhc |
| 20 | CVE-2025-59537 | 7.5  | HIGH | Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Versions 1.2.0 through 1.8.7, 2.0.0-rc1 through 2.14.19, 3.0.0-rc1 through 3.2.0-rc1, 3.1.7 and 3.0.18 are vulnerable to malicious API requests which can crash the API server and cause denial of service to legitimate clients. With the default configuration, no webhook.gogs.secret set, Argo CD’s /api/webhook endpoint will crash the entire argocd-server process when it receives a Gogs push event whose JSON field commits[].repo is not set or is null. This issue is fixed in versions 2.14.20, 3.2.0-rc2, 3.1.8 and 3.0.19. | [1]https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/761fc27068d2d4cd24e1f784eb2a9033b5ee7f43<br>[2]https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-wp4p-9pxh-cgx2 |
| 21 | CVE-2025-59538 | 7.5  | HIGH | Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. For versions 2.9.0-rc1 through 2.14.19, 3.0.0-rc1 through 3.2.0-rc1, 3.1.6 and 3.0.17, when the webhook.azuredevops.username and webhook.azuredevops.password are not set in the default configuration, the /api/webhook endpoint crashes the entire argocd-server process when it receives an Azure DevOps Push event whose JSON array resource.refUpdates is empty. The slice index [0] is accessed without a length check, causing an index-out-of-range panic. A single unauthenticated HTTP POST is enough to kill the process. This issue is resolved in versions 2.14.20, 3.2.0-rc2, 3.1.8 and 3.0.19. | [1]https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/1a023f1ca7fe4ec942b4b6696804988d5a632baf<br>[2]https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-gpx4-37g2-c8pv |
| 22 | CVE-2025-23297 | 7.8  | HIGH | NVIDIA Installer for NvAPP for Windows contains a vulnerability in the FrameviewSDK installation process, where an attacker with local unprivileged access could modify files in the Frameview SDK directory. A successful exploit of this vulnerability might lead to escalation of privileges. | [1]https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-23297<br>[2]https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5682<br>[3]https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23297 |
| 23 | CVE-2025-54811 | 7.1  | HIGH | OpenPLC_V3 has a vulnerability in the enipThread function that occurs due to the lack of a return value. This leads to a crash when the server loop ends and execution hits an illegal ud2 instruction. This issue can be triggered remotely without authentication by starting the same server multiple times or if the server exits unexpectedly. The vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) against the PLC runtime, stopping any PC started remotely without authentication. This results in the PLC process crashing and halting all automation or control logic managed by OpenPLC. | [1]https://github.com/thiagoralves/OpenPLC_v3<br>[2]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-25-273-05 |
| 24 | CVE-2025-61582 | 7.5  | HIGH | TS3 Manager is modern web interface for maintaining Teamspeak3 servers. A Denial of Dervice vulnerability has been identified in versions 2.2.1 and earlier. The vulnerability permits an unauthenticated actor to crash the application through the submission of specially crafted Unicode input, requiring no prior authentication or privileges. The flaw manifests when Unicode tag characters are submitted to the Server field on the login page. The application fails to properly handle these characters during the ASCII conversion process, resulting in an unhandled exception that terminates the application within four to five seconds of submission. This issue is fixed in version 2.2.2. | [1]https://github.com/joni1802/ts3-manager/commit/3a069915f97a6f5dae1fe0b2e32aa11a69d83b5e<br>[2]https://github.com/joni1802/ts3-manager/security/advisories/GHSA-4cq4-hp4f-8w7p |
