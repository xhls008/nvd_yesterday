| 1 | CVE-2024-9105 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The UltimateAI plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 2.8.3. This is due to insufficient verification on the user being supplied in the `ultimate_ai_register_or_login_with_google` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the email. | [1]https://codecanyon.net/item/ultimateai-ai-enhanced-wordpress-plugin-with-saas-for-content-code-chat-and-image-generation/51201953<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c2475643-a0b4-444a-a2c6-a5c45e90e1dd?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2024-9305 | 8.1  | HIGH | The AppPresser – Mobile App Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.4.

| 37 | CVE-2024-45216 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Improper Authentication vulnerability in Apache Solr.Solr instances using the PKIAuthenticationPlugin, which is enabled by default when Solr Authentication is used, are vulnerable to Authentication bypass.A fake ending at the end of any Solr API URL path, will allow requests to skip Authentication while maintaining the API contract with the original URL Path.This fake ending looks like an unprotected API path, however it is stripped off internally after authentication but before API routing.This issue affects Apache Solr: from 5.3.0 before 8.11.4, from 9.0.0 before 9.7.0.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.7.0, or 8.11.4, which fix the issue. | [1]https://solr.apache.org/security.html#cve-2024-45216-apache-solr-authentication-bypass-possible-using-a-fake-url-path-ending |

This issue does not affect Solr instances that are secured via Authentication/Authorization.Users are primarily recommended to use Authentication and Authorization when running Solr.

| 39 | CVE-2024-45219 | 8.5  | HIGH | Account users in Apache CloudStack by default are allowed to upload and register templates for deploying instances and volumes for attaching them as data disks to their existing instances. Due to missing validation checks for KVM-compatible templates or volumes in CloudStack 4.0.0 through 4.18.2.3 and 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.1.1, an attacker that can upload or register templates and volumes, can use them to deploy malicious instances or attach uploaded volumes to their existing instances on KVM-based environments and exploit this to gain access to the host filesystems that could result in the compromise of resource integrity and confidentiality, data loss, denial of service, and availability of KVM-based infrastructure managed by CloudStack.Users are recommended to upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.18.2.4 or 4.19.1.2, or later, which addresses this issue. Additionally, all user-uploaded or registered KVM-compatible templates and volumes can be scanned and checked that they are flat files that should not be using any additional or unnecessary features. For example, operators can run this on their secondary storage(s) and inspect output. An empty output for the disk being validated means it has no references to the host filesystems; on the other hand, if the output for the disk being validated is not empty, it might indicate a compromised disk.for file in $(find /path/to/storage/ -type f -regex [a-f0-9\-]*.*); do echo "Retrieving file [$file] info. If the output is not empty, that might indicate a compromised disk; check it carefully."; qemu-img info -U $file | grep file: ; printf "\n\n"; doneThe command can also be run for the file-based primary storages; however, bear in mind that (i) volumes created from templates will have references for the templates at first and (ii) volumes can be consolidated while migrating, losing their references to the templates. Therefore, the command execution for the primary storages can show both false positives and false negatives.For checking the whole template/volume features of each disk, operators can run the following command:for file in $(find /path/to/storage/ -type f -regex [a-f0-9\-]*.*); do echo "Retrieving file [$file] info."; qemu-img info -U $file; printf "\n\n"; done | [1]https://cloudstack.apache.org/blog/security-release-advisory-4.18.2.4-4.19.1.2<br>[2]https://lists.apache.org/thread/ktsfjcnj22x4kg49ctock3d9tq7jnvlo<br>[3]https://www.shapeblue.com/shapeblue-security-advisory-apache-cloudstack-security-releases-4-18-2-4-and-4-19-1-2/ |

This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. NOTE: This vulnerability was partially fixed in version 1.3.5 with a nonce check, which effectively prevented access to the affected function.

| 84 | CVE-2024-38814 | 8.8  | HIGH | An authenticated SQL injection vulnerability in VMware HCX was privately reported to VMware. A malicious authenticated user with non-administrator privileges may be able to enter specially crafted SQL queries and perform unauthorized remote code execution on the HCX manager. Updates are available to remediate this vulnerability in affected VMware products. | [1]https://support.broadcom.com/web/ecx/support-content-notification/-/external/content/SecurityAdvisories/0/25019 |
| 85 | CVE-2024-45795 | 7.5  | HIGH | Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to version 7.0.7, rules using datasets with the non-functional / unimplemented "unset" option can trigger an assertion during traffic parsing, leading to denial of service. This issue is addressed in 7.0.7. As a workaround, use only trusted and well tested rulesets. | [1]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-6r8w-fpw6-cp9g<br>[2]https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/7195 |
| 86 | CVE-2024-45797 | 7.5  | HIGH | LibHTP is a security-aware parser for the HTTP protocol and the related bits and pieces. Prior to version 0.5.49, unbounded processing of HTTP request and response headers can lead to excessive CPU time and memory utilization, possibly leading to extreme slowdowns. This issue is addressed in 0.5.49. | [1]https://github.com/OISF/libhtp/security/advisories/GHSA-rqqp-24ch-248f<br>[2]https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/7191 |
| 87 | CVE-2024-47187 | 7.5  | HIGH | Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to version 7.0.7, missing initialization of the random seed for "thash" leads to datasets having predictable hash table behavior. This can lead to dataset file loading to use excessive time to load, as well as runtime performance issues during traffic handling. This issue has been addressed in 7.0.7. As a workaround, avoid loading datasets from untrusted sources. Avoid dataset rules that track traffic in rules. | [1]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-64ww-4f6x-863p<br>[2]https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/7209 |
| 88 | CVE-2024-47188 | 7.5  | HIGH | Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to version 7.0.7, missing initialization of the random seed for "thash" leads to byte-range tracking having predictable hash table behavior. This can lead to an attacker forcing lots of data into a single hash bucket, leading to severe performance degradation. This issue has been addressed in 7.0.7. | [1]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-qq5v-qcjx-f872<br>[2]https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/7289 |
| 89 | CVE-2024-47522 | 7.5  | HIGH | Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to version 7.0.7, invalid ALPN in TLS/QUIC traffic when JA4 matching/logging is enabled can lead to Suricata aborting with a panic. This issue has been addressed in 7.0.7. One may disable ja4 as a workaround. | [1]https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-w5xv-6586-jpm7<br>[2]https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/7267 |
