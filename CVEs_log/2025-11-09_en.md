| 1 | CVE-2025-64489 | 8.3  | HIGH | SuiteCRM is an open-source, enterprise-ready Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software application. Versions 7.14.7 and prior, 8.0.0-beta.1 through 8.9.0 contain a privilege escalation vulnerability where user sessions are not invalidated upon account deactivation. An inactive user with an active session can continue to access the application and, critically, can self-reactivate their account. This undermines administrative controls and allows unauthorized persistence. This issue is fixed in versions 7.14.8 and 8.9.1. | [1]https://github.com/SuiteCRM/SuiteCRM-Core/commit/30277cfe69755f7360a23d4805e06a5c38f14131<br>[2]https://github.com/SuiteCRM/SuiteCRM/commit/40da2845a170832a4e9e9fa0ebe731f8c34de42d<br>[3]https://github.com/SuiteCRM/SuiteCRM/security/advisories/GHSA-j6jg-9jj3-q2ph |
| 2 | CVE-2025-64490 | 8.3  | HIGH | SuiteCRM is an open-source, enterprise-ready Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software application. Versions 7.14.7 and prior, 8.0.0-beta.1 through 8.9.0 allow a low-privileged user with a restrictive role to view and create work items through the Resource Calendar and project screens, even when the related modules (Projects, Project Tasks, Tasks, Leads, Accounts, Meetings, Calls) are explicitly set to Disabled/None in Role Management. This indicates inconsistent ACL/RBAC enforcement across modules and views, resulting in unauthorized data exposure and modification. This issue is fixed in versions 7.14.8 and 8.9.1. | [1]https://github.com/SuiteCRM/SuiteCRM/security/advisories/GHSA-jh8v-wqgj-hhc2 |
| 3 | CVE-2025-64492 | 8.8  | HIGH | SuiteCRM is an open-source, enterprise-ready Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software application. Versions 8.9.0 and below contain a time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to infer data from the database by measuring response times, potentially leading to the extraction of sensitive information. It is possible for an attacker to enumerate database, table, and column names, extract sensitive data, or escalate privileges. This is fixed in version 8.9.1. | [1]https://github.com/SuiteCRM/SuiteCRM-Core/security/advisories/GHSA-54m4-4p54-j8hp |
| 4 | CVE-2025-64495 | 8.7  | HIGH | Open WebUI is a self-hosted artificial intelligence platform designed to operate entirely offline. In versions 0.6.34 and below, the functionality that inserts custom prompts into the chat window is vulnerable to DOM XSS when `Insert Prompt as Rich Text` is enabled, since the prompt body is assigned to the DOM sink .innerHtml without sanitisation. Any user with permissions to create prompts can abuse this to plant a payload that could be triggered by other users if they run the corresponding / command to insert the prompt. This issue is fixed in version 0.6.35. | [1]https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/blob/7a83e7dfa367d19f762ec17cac5e4a94ea2bd97d/src/lib/components/common/RichTextInput.svelte#L348<br>[2]https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/commit/eb9c4c0e358c274aea35f21c2856c0a20051e5f1<br>[3]https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/security/advisories/GHSA-w7xj-8fx7-wfch |
| 5 | CVE-2025-64496 | 7.3  | HIGH | Open WebUI is a self-hosted artificial intelligence platform designed to operate entirely offline. Versions 0.6.224 and prior contain a code injection vulnerability in the Direct Connections feature that allows malicious external model servers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in victim browsers via Server-Sent Event (SSE) execute events. This leads to authentication token theft, complete account takeover, and when chained with the Functions API, enables remote code execution on the backend server. The attack requires the victim to enable Direct Connections (disabled by default) and add the attacker`s malicious model URL, achievable through social engineering of the admin and subsequent users. This issue is fixed in version 0.6.35. | [1]https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/commit/8af6a4cf21b756a66cd58378a01c60f74c39b7ca<br>[2]https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/security/advisories/GHSA-cm35-v4vp-5xvx |
| 6 | CVE-2025-11452 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Asgaros Forum plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the `$_COOKIE[`asgarosforum_unread_exclude`]` cookie in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://github.com/Asgaros/asgaros-forum/commit/41e499f26cb534c55587c35496e6f9056753b942<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3388337%40asgaros-forum&new=3388337%40asgaros-forum&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/75d66a45-5bb9-4e82-acd5-e0b92e3870a9?source=cve |
| 7 | CVE-2025-12161 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Smart Auto Upload Images plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the auto-image creation functionality in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?old_path=%2Fsmart-auto-upload-images%2Ftags%2F1.2.0&old=3388129&new_path=%2Fsmart-auto-upload-images%2Ftags%2F1.2.1&new=3388129&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/86dab8e6-b9fd-45ca-bdd1-8665f3bb75f2?source=cve |
| 8 | CVE-2025-9334 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Better Find and Replace – AI-Powered Suggestions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Limited Code Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.7. This is due to insufficient input validation and restriction on the `rtafar_ajax` function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to call arbitrary plugin functions and execute code within those functions. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/real-time-auto-find-and-replace/trunk/core/actions/RTAFAR_CustomAjax.php#L29<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/real-time-auto-find-and-replace/trunk/core/admin/functions/DbReplacer.php#L507<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/real-time-auto-find-and-replace/trunk/core/lib/Util.php#L233<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3389979/<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/232f3a15-3bd3-44fa-aa07-f055e8fcda88?source=cve |
| 9 | CVE-2025-12099 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Academy LMS – WordPress LMS Plugin for Complete eLearning Solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.8 via deserialization of untrusted input in the `import_all_courses` function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/academy/trunk/includes/ajax/course.php#L815<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3390420/<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/294b2a7c-8b54-4022-a3af-9a3e3d1d4c11?source=cve |
