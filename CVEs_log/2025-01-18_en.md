| 3 | CVE-2024-11146 | 7.3  | HIGH | TrueFiling is a collaborative, web-based electronic filing system where attorneys, paralegals, court reporters and self-represented filers collect public legal documentation into cases. TrueFiling is an entirely cloud-hosted application. Prior to version 3.1.112.19, TrueFiling trusted some client-controlled identifiers passed in URL requests to retrieve information. Platform users must self-register for an account, and once authenticated, could manipulate those identifiers to gain partial access to case information and the ability to partially change user access to case information. This vulnerability was addressed in version 3.1.112.19 and all instances were updated by 2024-11-08. | [1]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cisagov/CSAF/develop/csaf_files/IT/white/2024/va-25-017-01.json |
| 4 | CVE-2024-13333 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Advanced File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the `fma_local_file_system` function in versions 5.2.12 to 5.2.13.

| 22 | CVE-2025-23208 | 7.3  | HIGH | zot is a production-ready vendor-neutral OCI image registry. The group data stored for users in the boltdb database (meta.db) is an append-list so group revocations/removals are ignored in the API. SetUserGroups is alled on login, but instead of replacing the group memberships, they are appended. This may be due to some conflict with the group definitions in the config file, but that wasn`t obvious to me if it were the case. Any Zot configuration that relies on group-based authorization will not respect group remove/revocation by an IdP. This issue has been addressed in version 2.1.2. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/project-zot/zot/blob/5e30fec65c49e3139907e2819ccb39b2e3bd784e/pkg/meta/boltdb/boltdb.go#L1665<br>[2]https://github.com/project-zot/zot/commit/002ac62d8a15bf0cba010b3ba7bde86f9837b613<br>[3]https://github.com/project-zot/zot/security/advisories/GHSA-c9p4-xwr9-rfhx |
