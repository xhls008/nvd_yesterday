| 14 | CVE-2024-38514 | 7.4  | HIGH | NextChat is a cross-platform ChatGPT/Gemini UI. There is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability due to a lack of validation of the `endpoint` GET parameter on the WebDav API endpoint. This SSRF can be used to perform arbitrary HTTPS request from the vulnerable instance (MKCOL, PUT and GET methods supported), or to target NextChat users and make them execute arbitrary JavaScript code in their browser. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.12.4. | [1]https://github.com/ChatGPTNextWeb/ChatGPT-Next-Web/commit/dad122199a85c2f12277593973e1784b212adf5e<br>[2]https://github.com/ChatGPTNextWeb/ChatGPT-Next-Web/security/advisories/GHSA-gph5-rx77-3pjg |
| 15 | CVE-2024-38528 | 7.5  | HIGH | nptd-rs is a tool for synchronizing your computer`s clock, implementing the NTP and NTS protocols. There is a missing limit for accepted NTS-KE connections. This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to crash ntpd-rs when an NTS-KE server is configured. Non NTS-KE server configurations, such as the default ntpd-rs configuration, are unaffected. This vulnerability has been patched in version 1.1.3. | [1]https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-2xpx-vcmq-5f72 |
| 16 | CVE-2024-38525 | 7.5  | HIGH | dd-trace-cpp is the Datadog distributed tracing for C++. When the library fails to extract trace context due to malformed unicode, it logs the list of audited headers and their values using the `nlohmann` JSON library. However, due to the way the JSON library is invoked, it throws an uncaught exception, which results in a crash. This vulnerability has been patched in version 0.2.2. | [1]https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-cpp/releases/tag/v0.2.2<br>[2]https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-cpp/security/advisories/GHSA-rf3p-mg22-qv6w |
