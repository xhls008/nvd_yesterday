| 5 | CVE-2024-29194 | 8.3  | HIGH | OneUptime is a solution for monitoring and managing online services. The vulnerability lies in the improper validation of client-side stored data within the web application. Specifically, the is_master_admin key, stored in the local storage of the browser, can be manipulated by an attacker. By changing this key from false to true, the application grants administrative privileges to the user, without proper server-side validation.  This has been patched in 7.0.1815. | [1]https://github.com/OneUptime/oneuptime/commit/14016d23d834038dd65d3a96cf71af04b556a32c<br>[2]https://github.com/OneUptime/oneuptime/security/advisories/GHSA-246p-xmg8-wmcq |
| 6 | CVE-2024-29187 | 7.3  | HIGH | WiX toolset lets developers create installers for Windows Installer, the Windows installation engine. When a bundle runs as SYSTEM user, Burn uses GetTempPathW which points to an insecure directory C:\Windows\Temp to drop and load multiple binaries. Standard users can hijack the binary before it`s loaded in the application resulting in elevation of privileges. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.14.1 and 4.0.5. | [1]https://github.com/wixtoolset/issues/security/advisories/GHSA-rf39-3f98-xr7r<br>[2]https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix/commit/75a8c75d4e02ea219008dc5af7d03869291d61f7<br>[3]https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix3/commit/6d372e5169f1a334a395cdf496443bc0732098e9 |
| 7 | CVE-2024-29188 | 7.9  | HIGH | WiX toolset lets developers create installers for Windows Installer, the Windows installation engine. The custom action behind WiX`s `RemoveFolderEx` functionality could allow a standard user to delete protected directories. `RemoveFolderEx` deletes an entire directory tree during installation or uninstallation. It does so by recursing every subdirectory starting at a specified directory and adding each subdirectory to the list of directories Windows Installer should delete. If the setup author instructed `RemoveFolderEx` to delete a per-user folder from a per-machine installer, an attacker could create a directory junction in that per-user folder pointing to a per-machine, protected directory. Windows Installer, when executing the per-machine installer after approval by an administrator, would delete the target of the directory junction. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.14.1 and 4.0.5. | [1]https://github.com/wixtoolset/issues/security/advisories/GHSA-jx4p-m4wm-vvjg<br>[2]https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix/commit/2e5960b575881567a8807e6b8b9c513138b19742<br>[3]https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix3/commit/93eeb5f6835776694021f66d4226c262c67d487a |
