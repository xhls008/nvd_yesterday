| 47 | CVE-2025-64419 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications, and databases. Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.445, parameters coming from docker-compose.yaml are not sanitized when used in commands. If a victim user creates an application from an attacker repository (using build pack "docker compose"), the attacker can execute commands on the Coolify instance as root. Version 4.0.0-beta.445 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/commit/f86ccfaa9af572a5487da8ea46b0a125a4854cf6<br>[2]https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/security/advisories/GHSA-234r-xrrg-m8f3 |
| 48 | CVE-2025-64420 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications, and databases. In Coolify versions prior to and including v4.0.0-beta.434, low privileged users are able to see the private key of the root user on the Coolify instance. This allows them to ssh to the server and authenticate as root user, using the private key. As of time of publication, it is unclear if a patch is available. | [1]https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/security/advisories/GHSA-qwxj-qch7-whpc |
| 49 | CVE-2025-67419 | 7.5  | HIGH | A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in evershop 2.1.0 and prior allows unauthenticated attackers to exhaust the application server`s resources via the "GET /images" API. The application fails to limit the height of the use-element shadow tree or the dimensions of pattern tiles during the processing of SVG files, resulting in unbounded resource consumption and system-wide denial of service. | [1]https://github.com/dos-m0nk3y/CVE/tree/main/CVE-2025-67419<br>[2]https://github.com/evershopcommerce/evershop |

| 51 | CVE-2025-61916 | 7.9  | HIGH | Spinnaker is an open source, multi-cloud continuous delivery platform. Versions prior to 2025.1.6, 2025.2.3, and 2025.3.0 are vulnerable to server-side request forgery. The primary impact is allowing users to fetch data from a remote URL. This data can be then injected into spinnaker pipelines via helm or other methods to extract things LIKE idmsv1 authentication data. This also includes calling internal spinnaker API`s via a get and similar endpoints. Further, depending upon the artifact in question, auth data may be exposed to arbitrary endpoints (e.g. GitHub auth headers) leading to credentials exposure. To trigger this, a spinnaker installation MUST have two things. The first is an artifact enabled that allows user input. This includes GitHub file artifacts, BitBucket, GitLab, HTTP artifacts and similar artifact providers. JUST enabling the http artifact provider will add a "no-auth" http provider that could be used to extract link local data (e.g. AWS Metadata information). The second is a system that can consume the output of these artifacts. e.g. Rosco helm can use this to fetch values data. K8s account manifests if the API returns JSON can be used to inject that data into the pipeline itself though the pipeline would fail. This vulnerability is fixed in versions 2025.1.6, 2025.2.3, and 2025.3.0. As a workaround, disable HTTP account types that allow user input of a given URL. This is probably not feasible in most cases. Git, Docker and other artifact account types with explicit URL configurations bypass this limitation and should be safe as they limit artifact URL loading. Alternatively, use one of the various vendors which provide OPA policies to restrict pipelines from accessing or saving a pipeline with invalid URLs. | [1]https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/security/advisories/GHSA-vrjc-q2fh-6x9h |
| 52 | CVE-2025-65110 | 8.1  | HIGH | Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. Prior to versions 6.1.2 and 5.6.3, applications meeting two conditions are at risk of arbitrary JavaScript code execution, even if "safe mode" expressionInterpreter is used. First, they use `vega` in an application that attaches both `vega` library and a `vega.View` instance similar to the Vega Editor to the global `window`, or has any other satisfactory function gadgets in the global scope. Second, they allow user-defined Vega `JSON` definitions (vs JSON that was is only provided through source code). This vulnerability allows for DOM XSS, potentially stored, potentially reflected, depending on how the library is being used. The vulnerability requires user interaction with the page to trigger. An attacker can exploit this issue by tricking a user into opening a malicious Vega specification. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the application’s domain. This can lead to theft of sensitive information such as authentication tokens, manipulation of data displayed to the user, or execution of unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim. This exploit compromises confidentiality and integrity of impacted applications.Patched versions are available in `vega-selections@6.1.2` (requires ESM) for Vega v6 and `vega-selections@5.6.3` (no ESM needed) for Vega v5. As a workaround, do not attach `vega` or `vega.View` instances to global variables or the window as the editor used to do. This is a development-only debugging practice that should not be used in any situation where Vega/Vega-lite definitions can come from untrusted parties. | [1]https://github.com/vega/vega/security/advisories/GHSA-829q-m3qg-ph8r<br>[2]https://github.com/vega/vega/security/advisories/GHSA-829q-m3qg-ph8r |
| 53 | CVE-2025-66648 | 7.2  | HIGH | vega-functions provides function implementations for the Vega expression language. Prior to version 6.1.1, for sites that allow users to supply untrusted user input, malicious use of an internal function (not part of the public API) could be used to run unintentional javascript (XSS). This issue is fixed in vega-functions `6.1.1`. There is no workaround besides upgrading. Using `vega.expressionInterpreter` as described in CSP safe mode does not prevent this issue. | [1]https://github.com/vega/vega/security/advisories/GHSA-m9rg-mr6g-75gm |
| 54 | CVE-2025-68953 | 7.5  | HIGH | Frappe is a full-stack web application framework. Versions 14.99.5 and below and 15.0.0 through 15.80.1 include requests that are vulnerable to path traversal attacks. Arbitrary files from the server could be retrieved due to a lack of proper sanitization on some requests. This issue is fixed in versions 14.99.6 and 15.88.1. To workaround, changing the setup to use a reverse proxy is recommended. | [1]https://github.com/frappe/frappe/commit/3867fb112c3f7be1a863e40f19e9235719f784fb<br>[2]https://github.com/frappe/frappe/commit/959efd6a498cfaeaf7d4e0ab6cca78c36192d34d<br>[3]https://github.com/frappe/frappe/security/advisories/GHSA-xj39-3g4p-f46v |
