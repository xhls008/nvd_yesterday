| 1 | CVE-2022-49043 | 8.1  | HIGH | xmlXIncludeAddNode in xinclude.c in libxml2 before 2.11.0 has a use-after-free. | [1]https://github.com/php/php-src/issues/17467<br>[2]https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/5a19e21605398cef6a8b1452477a8705cb41562b |
| 2 | CVE-2024-10574 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Quiz Maker Business, Developer, and Agency plugins for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the `ays_save_google_credentials` function in all versions up to, and including, 8.8.0 (Business), up to, and including, 21.8.0 (Developer), and up to, and including, 31.8.0 (Agency). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the Google Sheets integration credentials within the plugin`s settings. Because the `client_id` parameter is not sanitized or escaped when used in output, this vulnerability could also be leveraged to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. | [1]https://ays-pro.com/changelog-for-quiz-maker-pro<br>[2]https://ays-pro.com/wordpress/quiz-maker<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d8a4feb3-908f-4fff-84f2-099f56d46f5b?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2024-10628 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Quiz Maker Business, Developer, and Agency plugins for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the ‘id’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 8.8.0 (Business), up to, and including, 21.8.0 (Developer), and up to, and including, 31.8.0 (Agency) due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. | [1]https://ays-pro.com/changelog-for-quiz-maker-pro<br>[2]https://ays-pro.com/wordpress/quiz-maker<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/9bd873e5-fd65-48c3-a71d-aaf6d8372606?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2024-10633 | 7.3  | HIGH | The Quiz Maker Business, Developer, and Agency plugins for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 8.8.0 (Business), up to, and including, 21.8.0 (Developer), and up to, and including, 31.8.0 (Agency). This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. | [1]https://ays-pro.com/changelog-for-quiz-maker-pro<br>[2]https://ays-pro.com/wordpress/quiz-maker<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/eb81f83f-a0e7-46d9-b106-fe31f8ad3eb9?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2024-46881 | 7.1  | HIGH | Develocity (formerly Gradle Enterprise) before 2024.1.8 has Incorrect Access Control. Project-level access control configuration was introduced in Enterprise Config schema version 8. Migration functionality from schema version 8 to versions 9 and 10 (in affected vulnerable versions) does not include the projects section of the configuration. This leads to all of the project settings being reset to their defaults when the old schema is loaded. In the case of projects.enabled, the default is false. Thus, using an enterprise config v8 results in Project level access control being disabled, even if it was previously enabled, and previously restricted project information disclosed. Most commonly, this occurs when a Develocity instance is upgraded from an earlier version. Specifically, this occurs if: Develocity 2023.3.X is upgraded to 2023.4.X; Develocity 2023.3.X is upgraded to 2024.1.X up to and including 2024.1.7; or Develocity 2023.4.X is upgraded to 2024.1.X up to and including 2024.1.7. The flaw does not occur when upgrading to a fixed version. An upgrade can only be triggered via administrator access, and cannot be forced by an external attacker. | [1]https://security.gradle.com/advisory/2024-03 |
| 6 | CVE-2024-11641 | 8.8  | HIGH | The VikBooking Hotel Booking Engine & PMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the `save` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change plugin access privileges via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Successful exploitation allows attackers with subscriber-level privileges and above to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3225861/vikbooking<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6eb6611d-7a4b-4ca8-b9cc-c156437e89b5?source=cve |
| 7 | CVE-2024-11936 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Zox News theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the `backup_options` and `restore_options` function in all versions up to, and including, 3.16.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/zox-news-professional-wordpress-news-magazine-theme/20381541<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/3f061e7f-6a87-4d4a-9b4e-8234883f2ebc?source=cve |
