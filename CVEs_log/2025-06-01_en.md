| 5 | CVE-2025-4103 | 8.8  | HIGH | The WP-GeoMeta plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to a missing capability check on the wp_ajax_wpgm_start_geojson_import() function in versions 0.3.4 to 0.3.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to elevate their privileges to that of an administrator. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-geometa/tags/0.3.4/lib/wp-geometa-dash.php#L896<br>[2]https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-geometa/#developers<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/43039f2a-b3f9-4836-8b55-e8a091b1a102?source=cve |
| 6 | CVE-2025-4607 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The PSW Front-end Login & Registration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.12 via the customer_registration() function. This is due to the use of a weak, low-entropy OTP mechanism in the forget() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to initiate a password reset for any user, including administrators, and elevate their privileges for full site takeover. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/psw-login-and-registration/trunk/public/class-prositegeneralfeatures-public.php#L323<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/psw-login-and-registration/trunk/public/class-prositegeneralfeatures-public.php#L493<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/psw-login-and-registration/trunk/public/class-prositegeneralfeatures-public.php#L731<br>[4]https://wordpress.org/plugins/psw-login-and-registration/#developers<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/a2d6e595-0682-4a41-a432-afbcb50144e8?source=cve |
| 7 | CVE-2025-4631 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Profitori plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to a missing capability check on the stocktend_object endpoint in versions 2.0.6.0 to 2.1.1.3. This makes it possible to trigger the save_object_as_user() function for objects whose `_datatype` is set to `users`,. This allows unauthenticated attackers to write arbitrary strings straight into the user’s wp_capabilities meta field, potentially elevating the privileges of an existing user account or a newly created one to that of an administrator. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/profitori/tags/2.1.1.3/profitori.php#L2675<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/profitori/tags/2.1.1.3/profitori.php#L2679<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/profitori/tags/2.1.1.3/profitori.php#L2698<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/profitori/tags/2.1.1.3/profitori.php#L3673<br>[5]https://wordpress.org/plugins/profitori/#developers<br>[6]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c764811f-e9dc-4c3d-b696-5792e70ff0b6?source=cve |
| 8 | CVE-2025-4672 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Offsprout Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to improper authorization placed on the permission_callback() function in versions 2.2.1 to 2.15.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to read, create, update or delete any user meta, including flipping their own wp_capabilities to administrator and fully escalate their privileges. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/offsprout-page-builder/tags/2.15.2/api/class-offsprout-api-extensions.php#L5<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/offsprout-page-builder/tags/2.15.2/api/class-offsprout-api-extensions.php#L514<br>[3]https://wordpress.org/plugins/offsprout-page-builder/#developers<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/9269d18d-8d83-43ff-b777-ba8f58321e9e?source=cve |

| 10 | CVE-2025-4857 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Newsletters plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 4.9.9.9 via the `file` parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/newsletters-lite/trunk/wp-mailinglist.php#L1584<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3303758/<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/33c0838a-5f86-4368-8bf9-da0582acbabf?source=cve |
