| 20 | CVE-2025-50681 | 7.5  | HIGH | igmpproxy 0.4 before commit 2b30c36 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted IGMPv3 membership report packet with a malicious source address. Due to insufficient validation in the `recv_igmp()` function in src/igmpproxy.c, an invalid group record type can trigger a NULL pointer dereference when logging the address using `inet_fmtsrc()`. This vulnerability can be exploited by sending malformed multicast traffic to a host running igmpproxy, leading to a crash. igmpproxy is used in various embedded networking environments and consumer-grade IoT devices (such as home routers and media gateways) to handle multicast traffic for IPTV and other streaming services. Affected devices that rely on unpatched versions of igmpproxy may be vulnerable to remote denial-of-service attacks across a LAN . | [1]https://gist.github.com/miora-sora/dac1612d16c45c2aedb8605478adc28f<br>[2]https://github.com/pali/igmpproxy/issues/97<br>[3]https://github.com/younix/igmpproxy/commit/2b30c36e6ab5b21defb76ec6458ab7687984484c<br>[4]https://github.com/pali/igmpproxy/issues/97 |
| 21 | CVE-2025-66909 | 7.5  | HIGH | Turms AI-Serving module v0.10.0-SNAPSHOT and earlier contains an image decompression bomb denial of service vulnerability. The ExtendedOpenCVImage class in ai/djl/opencv/ExtendedOpenCVImage.java loads images using OpenCV`s imread() function without validating dimensions or pixel count before decompression. An attacker can upload a specially crafted compressed image file (e.g., PNG) that is small when compressed but expands to gigabytes of memory when loaded. This causes immediate memory exhaustion, OutOfMemoryError, and service crash. No authentication is required if the OCR service is publicly accessible. Multiple requests can completely deny service availability. | [1]https://github.com/Xzzz111/public_cve_report/blob/main/CVE-2025-66909_report.md<br>[2]https://github.com/turms-im/turms<br>[3]https://github.com/turms-im/turms/blob/develop/turms-ai-serving/src/main/java/ai/djl/opencv/ExtendedOpenCVImage.java#L37<br>[4]https://github.com/Xzzz111/public_cve_report/blob/main/CVE-2025-66909_report.md |

| 28 | CVE-2025-66580 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | Dive is an open-source MCP Host Desktop Application that enables integration with function-calling LLMs. A critical Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in versions prior to 0.11.1 in the Mermaid diagram rendering component. The application allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript via `javascript:`. An attacker can exploit this to inject a malicious Model Context Protocol (MCP) server configuration, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the victim`s machine when the node is clicked. Version 0.11.1 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/OpenAgentPlatform/Dive/security/advisories/GHSA-xv8m-365j-x6h2<br>[2]https://github.com/OpenAgentPlatform/Dive/security/advisories/GHSA-xv8m-365j-x6h2 |
| 29 | CVE-2025-68477 | 7.7  | HIGH | Langflow is a tool for building and deploying AI-powered agents and workflows. Prior to version 1.7.0, Langflow provides an API Request component that can issue arbitrary HTTP requests within a flow. This component takes a user-supplied URL, performs only normalization and basic format checks, and then sends the request using a server-side httpx client. It does not block private IP ranges (127[.]0[.]0[.]1, the 10/172/192 ranges) or cloud metadata endpoints (169[.]254[.]169[.]254), and it returns the response body as the result. Because the flow execution endpoints (/api/v1/run, /api/v1/run/advanced) can be invoked with just an API key, if an attacker can control the API Request URL in a flow, non-blind SSRF is possible—accessing internal resources from the server’s network context. This enables requests to, and collection of responses from, internal administrative endpoints, metadata services, and internal databases/services, leading to information disclosure and providing a foothold for further attacks. Version 1.7.0 contains a patch for this issue. | [1]https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/security/advisories/GHSA-5993-7p27-66g5<br>[2]https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/security/advisories/GHSA-5993-7p27-66g5 |

| 32 | CVE-2025-68478 | 7.1  | HIGH | Langflow is a tool for building and deploying AI-powered agents and workflows. Prior to version 1.7.0, if an arbitrary path is specified in the request body`s `fs_path`, the server serializes the Flow object into JSON and creates/overwrites a file at that path. There is no path restriction, normalization, or allowed directory enforcement, so absolute paths (e.g., /etc/poc.txt) are interpreted as is. Version 1.7.0 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/security/advisories/GHSA-f43r-cc68-gpx4<br>[2]https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/security/advisories/GHSA-f43r-cc68-gpx4 |

| 49 | CVE-2025-68613 | 9.9  | CRITICAL | n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. Versions starting with 0.211.0 and prior to 1.120.4, 1.121.1, and 1.122.0 contain a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in their workflow expression evaluation system. Under certain conditions, expressions supplied by authenticated users during workflow configuration may be evaluated in an execution context that is not sufficiently isolated from the underlying runtime. An authenticated attacker could abuse this behavior to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the n8n process. Successful exploitation may lead to full compromise of the affected instance, including unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of workflows, and execution of system-level operations. This issue has been fixed in versions 1.120.4, 1.121.1, and 1.122.0. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to a patched version, which introduces additional safeguards to restrict expression evaluation. If upgrading is not immediately possible, administrators should consider the following temporary mitigations: Limit workflow creation and editing permissions to fully trusted users only; and/or deploy n8n in a hardened environment with restricted operating system privileges and network access to reduce the impact of potential exploitation. These workarounds do not fully eliminate the risk and should only be used as short-term measures. | [1]https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/commit/08f332015153decdda3c37ad4fcb9f7ba13a7c79<br>[2]https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/commit/1c933358acef527ff61466e53268b41a04be1000<br>[3]https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/commit/39a2d1d60edde89674ca96dcbb3eb076ffff6316<br>[4]https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/security/advisories/GHSA-v98v-ff95-f3cp |
