| 205 | CVE-2024-39698 | 7.5  | HIGH | electron-updater allows for automatic updates for Electron apps. The file `packages/electron-updater/src/windowsExecutableCodeSignatureVerifier.ts` implements the signature validation routine for Electron applications on Windows. Because of the surrounding shell, a first pass by `cmd.exe` expands any environment variable found in command-line above. This creates a situation where `verifySignature()` can be tricked into validating the certificate of a different file than the one that was just downloaded. If the step is successful, the malicious update will be executed even if its signature is invalid. This attack assumes a compromised update manifest (server compromise, Man-in-the-Middle attack if fetched over HTTP, Cross-Site Scripting to point the application to a malicious updater server, etc.). The patch is available starting from 6.3.0-alpha.6. | [1]https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/blob/140e2f0eb0df79c2a46e35024e96d0563355fc89/packages/electron-updater/src/windowsExecutableCodeSignatureVerifier.ts#L35-L41<br>[2]https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/commit/ac2e6a25aa491c1ef5167a552c19fc2085cd427f<br>[3]https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/pull/8295<br>[4]https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/security/advisories/GHSA-9jxc-qjr9-vjxq |

| 209 | CVE-2024-34123 | 7.0  | HIGH | Premiere Pro versions 23.6.5, 24.4.1 and earlier are affected by an Untrusted Search Path vulnerability that could lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting a malicious file into the search path, which the application might execute instead of the legitimate file. This could occur when the application uses a search path to locate executables or libraries. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction, attack complexity is high. | [1]https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/premiere_pro/apsb24-46.html |
| 210 | CVE-2024-38517 | 7.8  | HIGH | Tencent RapidJSON is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to an integer underflow in the `GenericReader::ParseNumber()` function of `include/rapidjson/reader.h` when parsing JSON text from a stream. An attacker needs to send the victim a crafted file which needs to be opened; this triggers the integer underflow vulnerability (when the file is parsed), leading to elevation of privilege. | [1]https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson/pull/1261/commits/8269bc2bc289e9d343bae51cdf6d23ef0950e001<br>[2]https://github.com/fmalita/rapidjson/commit/8269bc2bc289e9d343bae51cdf6d23ef0950e001<br>[3]https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-38517 |
