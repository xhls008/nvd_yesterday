| 1 | CVE-2025-2525 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Streamit theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the `st_Authentication_Controller::edit_profile` function in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level and above permissions, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. | [1]https://documentation.iqonic.design/streamit/change-log/streamit-v4-0/<br>[2]https://themeforest.net/item/streamit-video-streaming-wordpress-theme/29772881<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/83a58119-d0ed-47fe-93d1-1aa1def2cf44?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2025-2526 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Streamit theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.2. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user`s identity prior to updating their details like email in the `st_Authentication_Controller::edit_profile` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user`s email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user`s password and gain access to their account. | [1]https://documentation.iqonic.design/streamit/change-log/streamit-v4-0/<br>[2]https://themeforest.net/item/streamit-video-streaming-wordpress-theme/29772881<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/057abffb-1c52-49ca-8791-ca44f0c5a011?source=cve |

| 40 | CVE-2025-32018 | 8.0  | HIGH | Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions 0.45.0 through 0.48.6, the Cursor app introduced a regression affecting the set of file paths the Cursor Agent is permitted to modify automatically. Under specific conditions, the agent could be prompted, either directly by the user or via maliciously crafted context, to automatically write to files outside of the opened workspace. This behavior required deliberate prompting, making successful exploitation highly impractical in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, the edited file was still displayed in the UI as usual for user review, making it unlikely for the edit to go unnoticed by the user. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.48.7. | [1]https://github.com/getcursor/cursor/security/advisories/GHSA-qjh8-mh96-fc86 |
