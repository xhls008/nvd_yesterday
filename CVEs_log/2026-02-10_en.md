| 43 | CVE-2026-25881 | 9.0  | CRITICAL | SandboxJS is a JavaScript sandboxing library. Prior to 0.8.31, a sandbox escape vulnerability allows sandboxed code to mutate host built-in prototypes by laundering the isGlobal protection flag through array literal intermediaries. When a global prototype reference (e.g., Map.prototype, Set.prototype) is placed into an array and retrieved, the isGlobal taint is stripped, permitting direct prototype mutation from within the sandbox. This results in persistent host-side prototype pollution and may enable RCE in applications that use polluted properties in sensitive sinks (example gadget: execSync(obj.cmd)). This vulnerability is fixed in 0.8.31. | [1]https://github.com/nyariv/SandboxJS/commit/f369f8db26649f212a6a9a2e7a1624cb2f705b53<br>[2]https://github.com/nyariv/SandboxJS/security/advisories/GHSA-ww7g-4gwx-m7wj |
| 44 | CVE-2026-25890 | 8.1  | HIGH | File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. Prior to 2.57.1, an authenticated user can bypass the application`s "Disallow" file path rules by modifying the request URL. By adding multiple slashes (e.g., //private/) to the path, the authorization check fails to match the rule, while the underlying filesystem resolves the path correctly, granting unauthorized access to restricted files. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.57.1. | [1]https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/commit/489af403a19057f6b6b4b1dc0e48cbb26a202ef9<br>[2]https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/releases/tag/v2.57.1<br>[3]https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/security/advisories/GHSA-4mh3-h929-w968 |
| 45 | CVE-2026-25892 | 7.5  | HIGH | Adminer is open-source database management software. Adminer v5.4.1 and earlier has a version check mechanism where adminer.org sends signed version info via JavaScript postMessage, which the browser then POSTs to ?script=version. This endpoint lacks origin validation and accepts POST data from any source. An attacker can POST version[] parameter which PHP converts to an array. On next page load, openssl_verify() receives this array instead of string and throws TypeError, returning HTTP 500 to all users. Upgrade to Adminer 5.4.2. | [1]https://github.com/vrana/adminer/commit/21d3a3150388677b18647d68aec93b7850e457d3<br>[2]https://github.com/vrana/adminer/releases/tag/v5.4.2<br>[3]https://github.com/vrana/adminer/security/advisories/GHSA-q4f2-39gr-45jh |
| 46 | CVE-2026-25925 | 7.8  | HIGH | PowerDocu contains a Windows GUI executable to perform technical documentations. Prior to 2.4.0, PowerDocu contains a critical security vulnerability in how it parses JSON files within Flow or App packages. The application blindly trusts the $type property in JSON files, allowing an attacker to instantiate arbitrary .NET objects and execute code. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.4.0. | [1]https://github.com/modery/PowerDocu/releases/tag/v-2.4.0<br>[2]https://github.com/modery/PowerDocu/security/advisories/GHSA-m8j2-5jr7-2jpw |
| 47 | CVE-2026-25961 | 7.5  | HIGH | SumatraPDF is a multi-format reader for Windows. In 3.5.0 through 3.5.2, SumatraPDF`s update mechanism disables TLS hostname verification (INTERNET_FLAG_IGNORE_CERT_CN_INVALID) and executes installers without signature checks. A network attacker with any valid TLS certificate (e.g., Let`s Encrypt) can intercept the update check request, inject a malicious installer URL, and achieve arbitrary code execution. | [1]https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/security/advisories/GHSA-xpm2-rr5m-x96q |

| 49 | CVE-2026-25931 | 7.8  | HIGH | vscode-spell-checker is a basic spell checker that works well with code and documents. Prior to v4.5.4, DocumentSettings._determineIsTrusted treats the configuration value cSpell.trustedWorkspace as the authoritative trust flag. The value defaults to true (package.json) and is read from workspace configuration each time settings are fetched. The code coerces any truthy value to true and forwards it to ConfigLoader.setIsTrusted , which in turn allows JavaScript/TypeScript configuration files ( .cspell.config.js/.mjs/.ts , etc.) to be located and executed. Because no VS Code workspace-trust state is consulted, an untrusted workspace can keep the flag true and place a malicious .cspell.config.js ; opening the workspace causes the extension host to execute attacker-controlled Node.js code with the user’s privileges. This vulnerability is fixed in v4.5.4. | [1]https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mT4SOkkHSHU6NFfKwekysydAd3FUAC6K/view?usp=sharing<br>[2]https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker/commit/f39af9a3a6f2a939a57171a24161ed735d41c575<br>[3]https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker/releases/tag/code-spell-checker-v4.5.4<br>[4]https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker/security/advisories/GHSA-mggq-68mr-58vj |
