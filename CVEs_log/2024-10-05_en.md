| 4 | CVE-2024-47183 | 8.1  | HIGH | Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. If the Parse Server option allowCustomObjectId: true is set, an attacker that is allowed to create a new user can set a custom object ID for that new user that exploits the vulnerability and acquires privileges of a specific role. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.5.9 and 7.3.0. | [1]https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/13ee52f0d19ef3a3524b3d79aea100e587eb3cfc<br>[2]https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/1bfbccf9ee7ea77533b2b2aa7c4c69f3bd35e66f<br>[3]https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/pull/9317<br>[4]https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/pull/9318<br>[5]https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-8xq9-g7ch-35hg |
| 5 | CVE-2024-47769 | 7.5  | HIGH | IDURAR is open source ERP CRM accounting invoicing software. The vulnerability exists in the corePublicRouter.js file. Using the reference usage here, it is identified that the public endpoint is accessible to an unauthenticated user. The user`s input is directly appended to the join statement without additional checks. This allows an attacker to send URL encoded malicious payload. The directory structure can be escaped to read system files by adding an encoded string (payload) at subpath location. | [1]https://github.com/idurar/idurar-erp-crm/commit/949bc6fe31f3175c9e1864d30cf6c8110179ac14<br>[2]https://github.com/idurar/idurar-erp-crm/security/advisories/GHSA-948g-2vm7-mfv7 |
