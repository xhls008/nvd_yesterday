| 5 | CVE-2024-12641 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | TenderDocTransfer from Chunghwa Telecom has a Reflected Cross-site scripting vulnerability. The application sets up a simple local web server and provides APIs for communication with the target website. Due to the lack of CSRF protection for the APIs, unauthenticated remote attackers could use specific APIs through phishing to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user’s browser. Since the web server set by the application supports Node.Js features, attackers can further leverage this to run OS commands. | [1]https://www.twcert.org.tw/en/cp-139-8299-42168-2.html<br>[2]https://www.twcert.org.tw/tw/cp-132-8292-4fd98-1.html |
| 6 | CVE-2024-12642 | 8.1  | HIGH | TenderDocTransfer from Chunghwa Telecom has an Arbitrary File Write vulnerability. The application sets up a simple local web server and provides APIs for communication with the target website.

| 8 | CVE-2024-12644 | 7.1  | HIGH | The tbm-client from Chunghwa Telecom has an Arbitrary File vulnerability. The application sets up a simple local web server and provides APIs for communication with the target website. Due to the lack of CSRF protection in the APIs, unauthenticated remote attackers could use these APIs through phishing. Additionally, one of the APIs contains an Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability. Attackers can copy arbitrary files on the user`s system and paste them into any path, which poses a potential risk of information leakage or could consume hard drive space by copying files in large volumes. | [1]https://www.twcert.org.tw/en/cp-139-8302-86814-2.html<br>[2]https://www.twcert.org.tw/tw/cp-132-8296-0f020-1.html |

| 15 | CVE-2024-12668 | 8.2  | HIGH | Velocidex WinPmem versions below 4.1 suffer from an Out of Bounds Write vulnerability. By using an IO Control, a user space program can trick the driver into writing a 0 into any chosen memory location. In conjunction with information leakage from the WinPmem driver, attackers can discover the location in memory for the  g_CiOptions global symbol. This can be leveraged to disable signed driver enforcement on the target system - allowing attackers to load unsigned drivers. | [1]https://github.com/Velocidex/WinPmem/releases/tag/v4.1.dev1 |
