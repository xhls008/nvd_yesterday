| 30 | CVE-2025-62514 | 8.3  | HIGH | Parsec is a cloud-based application for cryptographically secure file sharing. In versions on the 3.x branch prior to 3.6.0, `libparsec_crypto`, a component of the Parsec application, does not check for weak order point of Curve25519 when compiled with its RustCrypto backend. In practice this means an attacker in a man-in-the-middle position would be able to provide weak order points to both parties in the Diffie-Hellman exchange, resulting in a high probability to for both parties to obtain the same shared key (hence leading to a successful SAS code exchange, misleading both parties into thinking no MITM has occurred) which is also known by the attacker. Note only Parsec web is impacted (as Parsec desktop uses `libparsec_crypto` with the libsodium backend). Version 3.6.0 of Parsec patches the issue. | [1]https://github.com/Scille/parsec-cloud/blob/e7c5cdbc4234f606ccf3ab2be7e9edc22db16feb/libparsec/crates/crypto/src/rustcrypto/private.rs#L136-L138<br>[2]https://github.com/Scille/parsec-cloud/commit/197bb6387b49fec872b5e4a04dcdb82b3d2995b2<br>[3]https://github.com/Scille/parsec-cloud/security/advisories/GHSA-hrc9-gm58-pgj9<br>[4]https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek/blob/8c53a8f10b146a2fd65069437e3576e49b390e7a/curve25519-dalek/src/montgomery.rs#L132-L146<br>[5]https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek/blob/8c53a8f10b146a2fd65069437e3576e49b390e7a/x25519-dalek/src/x25519.rs#L364-L366 |

This occurs due to improper sanitization of the template_md parameter, enabling direct injection of Jinja2 templates. This occurs due to misuse of the generate_html() function, the user-controlled value is inserted into `env.from_string`, a function that processes Jinja2 templates arbitrarily, making an SSTI possible. | [1]https://gist.github.com/NtGabrielGomes/7c424367cc316fd7527f668ff076fece<br>[2]https://github.com/amidaware/tacticalrmm<br>[3]https://www.amidaware.com/ |
| 36 | CVE-2026-22806 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | vCluster Platform provides a Kubernetes platform for managing virtual clusters, multi-tenancy, and cluster sharing. Prior to versions 4.6.0, 4.5.4, 4.4.2, and 4.3.10, when an access key is created with a limited scope, the scope can be bypassed to access resources outside of it. However, the user still cannot access resources beyond what is accessible to the owner of the access key. Versions 4.6.0, 4.5.4, 4.4.2, and 4.3.10 fix the vulnerability. Some other mitigations are available. Users can limit exposure by reviewing access keys which are scoped and ensuring any users with access to them have appropriate permissions set. Creating automation users with very limited permissions and using access keys for these automation users can be used as a temporary workaround where upgrading is not immediately possible but scoped access keys are needed. | [1]https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/security/advisories/GHSA-c539-w4ch-7wxq |

In `tcp_forwarder.rs`, SSRF protection for `allow_private_network_connections = false` was only applied in the `TcpDestination::HostName(peer)` path. The `TcpDestination::Address(peer) => peer` path proceeded to `TcpStream::connect()` without equivalent checks (for example `is_global_ip`, `is_loopback`), allowing loopback/private targets to be reached by supplying a numeric IP.

Starting in version 4.5.0 and prior to version 4.7.2, an unauthenticated Path Traversal vulnerability in the `UserConfigController` allows any remote user to overwrite the system`s `docker-compose.yml` configuration file. By exploiting insecure URN parsing, an attacker can replace the primary stack configuration with a malicious one, resulting in full Remote Code Execution (RCE) and host filesystem compromise the next time the instance is restarted by the operator. Version 4.7.2 fixes the vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/runtipi/runtipi/releases/tag/v4.7.2<br>[2]https://github.com/runtipi/runtipi/security/advisories/GHSA-mwg8-x997-cqw6 |
| 41 | CVE-2026-25126 | 7.1  | HIGH | PolarLearn is a free and open-source learning program. Prior to version 0-PRERELEASE-15, the vote API route (`POST /api/v1/forum/vote`) trusts the JSON body’s `direction` value without runtime validation. TypeScript types are not enforced at runtime, so an attacker can send arbitrary strings (e.g., `"x"`) as `direction`. Downstream (`VoteServer`) treats any non-`"up"` and non-`null` value as a downvote and persists the invalid value in `votes_data`. This can be exploited to bypass intended business logic. Version 0-PRERELEASE-15 fixes the vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/polarnl/PolarLearn/commit/e6227d94d0e53e854f6a46480db8cd1051184d41<br>[2]https://github.com/polarnl/PolarLearn/security/advisories/GHSA-ghpx-5w2p-p3qp |
