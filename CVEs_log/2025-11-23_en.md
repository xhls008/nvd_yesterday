| 1 | CVE-2025-13384 | 7.5  | HIGH | The CP Contact Form with PayPal plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.56. This is due to the plugin exposing an unauthenticated IPN-like endpoint (via the `cp_contactformpp_ipncheck` query parameter) that processes payment confirmations without any authentication, nonce verification, or PayPal IPN signature validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to mark form submissions as paid without making actual payments by sending forged payment notification requests with arbitrary POST data (payment_status, txn_id, payer_email). | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/cp-contact-form-with-paypal/tags/1.3.56/cp_contactformpp_functions.php#L541<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/cp-contact-form-with-paypal/tags/1.3.56/cp_contactformpp_functions.php#L877<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/cp-contact-form-with-paypal/tags/1.3.56/cp_contactformpp_functions.php#L925<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3399104%40cp-contact-form-with-paypal&new=3399104%40cp-contact-form-with-paypal&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6639c3d8-8f26-4ee5-8c4b-2efcf34668a2?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2025-13526 | 7.5  | HIGH | The OneClick Chat to Order plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.8 via the `wa_order_thank_you_override` function due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view sensitive customer information including names, email addresses, phone numbers, billing/shipping addresses, order contents, and payment methods by simply changing the order ID in the URL. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/oneclick-whatsapp-order/trunk/includes/buttons/wa-order-thank-you.php#L126<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3391625/<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/547a0c73-044e-49ba-9bec-4f80b41b8ea2?source=cve |
