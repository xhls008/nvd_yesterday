| 1 | CVE-2024-47072 | 7.5  | HIGH | XStream is a simple library to serialize objects to XML and back again. This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream when XStream is configured to use the BinaryStreamDriver. XStream 1.4.21 has been patched to detect the manipulation in the binary input stream causing the the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may catch the StackOverflowError in the client code calling XStream if XStream is configured to use the BinaryStreamDriver. | [1]https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/commit/bb838ce2269cac47433e31c77b2b236466e9f266<br>[2]https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/security/advisories/GHSA-hfq9-hggm-c56q<br>[3]https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2024-47072.html |
| 2 | CVE-2024-51998 | 8.6  | HIGH | changedetection.io is a free open source web page change detection tool. The validation for the file URI scheme falls short, and results in an attacker being able to read any file on the system. This issue only affects instances with a webdriver enabled, and `ALLOW_FILE_URI` false or not defined. The check used for URL protocol, `is_safe_url`, allows `file:` as a URL scheme. It later checks if local files are permitted, but one of the preconditions for the check is that the URL starts with `file://`. The issue comes with the fact that the file URI scheme is not required to have double slashes. This issue has been addressed in version 0.47.06 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/blob/e0abf0b50507a8a3d0c1d8522ab23519b3e4cdf4/changedetectionio/model/Watch.py#L11-L13<br>[2]https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/commit/49bc982c697169c98b79698889fb9d26f6b3317f<br>[3]https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/security/advisories/GHSA-6jrf-rcjf-245r |

| 14 | CVE-2024-50588 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | An unauthenticated attacker with access to the local network of the medical office can use known default credentials to gain remote DBA access to the Elefant Firebird database. The data in the database includes patient data and login credentials among other sensitive data. In addition, this enables an attacker to create and overwrite arbitrary files on the server filesystem with the rights of the Firebird database ("NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"). | [1]https://hasomed.de/produkte/elefant/<br>[2]https://r.sec-consult.com/hasomed |

| 17 | CVE-2024-50590 | 7.8  | HIGH | Attackers with local access to the medical office computer can escalate their Windows user privileges to "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" by overwriting one of two Elefant service binaries with weak permissions. The default installation directory of Elefant is "C:\Elefant1" which is writable for all users. In addition, the Elefant installer registers two Firebird database services which are running as “NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM”. Path: C:\Elefant1\Firebird_2\bin\fbserver.exePath: C:\Elefant1\Firebird_2\bin\fbguard.exeBoth service binaries are user writable. This means that a local attacker can rename one of the service binaries, replace the service executable with a new executable, and then restart the system. Once the system has rebooted, the new service binary is executed as "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM". | [1]https://hasomed.de/produkte/elefant/<br>[2]https://r.sec-consult.com/hasomed |
| 18 | CVE-2024-50591 | 7.8  | HIGH | An attacker with local access the to medical office computer can escalate his Windows user privileges to "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" by exploiting a command injection vulnerability in the Elefant Update Service. The command injection can be exploited by communicating with the Elefant Update Service which is running as "SYSTEM" via Windows Named Pipes.The Elefant Software Updater (ESU) consists of two components. An ESU service which runs as "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" and an ESU tray client which communicates with the service to update or repair the installation and is running with user permissions. The communication is implemented using named pipes. A crafted message of type "MessageType.SupportServiceInfos" can be sent to the local ESU service to inject commands, which are then executed as "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM". | [1]https://hasomed.de/produkte/elefant/<br>[2]https://r.sec-consult.com/hasomed |
| 19 | CVE-2024-50593 | 7.8  | HIGH | An attacker with local access to the medical office computer can access restricted functions of the Elefant Service tool by using a hard-coded "Hotline" password in the Elefant service binary, which is shipped with the software. | [1]https://hasomed.de/produkte/elefant/<br>[2]https://r.sec-consult.com/hasomed |
| 20 | CVE-2024-50592 | 7.0  | HIGH | An attacker with local access the to medical office computer can escalate his Windows user privileges to "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" by exploiting a race condition in the Elefant Update Service during the repair or update process. When using the repair function, the service queries the server for a list of files and their hashes. In addition, instructions to execute binaries to finalize the repair process are included. The executables are executed as "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" after they are copied over to the user writable installation folder (C:\Elefant1). This means that a user can overwrite either "PostESUUpdate.exe" or "Update_OpenJava.exe" in the time frame after the copy and before the execution of the final repair step. The overwritten executable is then executed as "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM". | [1]https://hasomed.de/produkte/elefant/<br>[2]https://r.sec-consult.com/hasomed |

| 25 | CVE-2024-51997 | 8.1  | HIGH | Trustee is a set of tools and components for attesting confidential guests and providing secrets to them. The ART (**Attestation Results Token**) token, generated by AS, could be manipulated by MITM attacker, but the verifier (CoCo Verification Demander like KBS) could still verify it successfully. In the payload of ART token, the ‘jwk’ could be replaced by attacker with his own pub key. Then attacker can use his own corresponding private key to sign the crafted ART token. Based on current code implementation (v0.8.0), such replacement and modification can not be detected. This issue has been addressed in version 0.8.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/confidential-containers/trustee/security/advisories/GHSA-7jc6-j236-vvjw |
| 26 | CVE-2024-52007 | 8.6  | HIGH | HAPI FHIR is a complete implementation of the HL7 FHIR standard for healthcare interoperability in Java. XSLT parsing performed by various components are vulnerable to XML external entity injections. A processed XML file with a malicious DTD tag ( <!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY example SYSTEM "/etc/passwd"> ]> could produce XML containing data from the host system. This impacts use cases where org.hl7.fhir.core is being used to within a host where external clients can submit XML. This is related to GHSA-6cr6-ph3p-f5rf, in which its fix (#1571 & #1717) was incomplete. This issue has been addressed in release version 6.4.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | [1]https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#jaxp-documentbuilderfactory-saxparserfactory-and-dom4j<br>[2]https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html<br>[3]https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/issues/1571<br>[4]https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/pull/1717<br>[5]https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/security/advisories/GHSA-6cr6-ph3p-f5rf<br>[6]https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/security/advisories/GHSA-gr3c-q7xf-47vh |
