| 3 | CVE-2025-11877 | 7.5  | HIGH | The User Activity Log plugin is vulnerable to a limited options update in versions up to, and including, 2.2. The failed-login handler `ual_shook_wp_login_failed` lacks a capability check and writes failed usernames directly into update_option() calls. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to push select site options from 0 to a non-zero value, allowing them to reopen registration or corrupt options like `wp_user_roles`, breaking wp-admin access. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/user-activity-log/trunk/user-functions.php<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/24225f47-cec2-4270-88f0-8696ebfb7168?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2025-13371 | 8.6  | HIGH | The MoneySpace plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 2.13.9. This is due to the plugin storing full payment card details (PAN, card holder name, expiry month/year, and CVV) in WordPress post_meta using base64_encode(), and then embedding these values into the publicly accessible mspaylink page`s inline JavaScript without any authentication or authorization check. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers who know or can guess an order_id to access the mspaylink endpoint and retrieve full credit card numbers and CVV codes directly from the HTML/JS response, constituting a severe PCI-DSS violation. | [1]https://github.com/MoneySpace-net/money-space-for-Woocommerce/blob/e79d96cfc1b12cece15c6f0b309045403cc6a9d2/view/mspaylink.php#L164<br>[2]https://github.com/MoneySpace-net/money-space-for-Woocommerce/blob/e79d96cfc1b12cece15c6f0b309045403cc6a9d2/view/mspaylink.php#L232<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/money-space/tags/2.13.9/view/mspaylink.php#L232<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/money-space/trunk/view/mspaylink.php#L232<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/77db827d-9afd-4b59-b0ad-1ad562634c52?source=cve |

| 40 | CVE-2025-67364 | 7.5  | HIGH | fast-filesystem-mcp version 3.4.0 contains a critical path traversal vulnerability in its file operation tools including fast_read_file. This vulnerability arises from improper path validation that fails to resolve symbolic links to their actual physical paths. The safePath and isPathAllowed functions use path.resolve() which does not handle symlinks, allowing attackers to bypass directory access restrictions by creating symlinks within allowed directories that point to restricted system paths. When these symlinks are accessed through valid path references, the validation checks are circumvented, enabling access to unauthorized files. | [1]https://github.com/efforthye/fast-filesystem-mcp<br>[2]https://github.com/efforthye/fast-filesystem-mcp/issues/10 |

Version 0.5.8 of filesystem-mcp contains a critical path traversal vulnerability in its "read_content" tool. This vulnerability arises from improper symlink handling in the path validation mechanism: the resolvePath function checks path validity before resolving symlinks, while fs.readFile resolves symlinks automatically during file access. This allows attackers to bypass directory restrictions by leveraging symlinks within the allowed directory that point to external files, enabling unauthorized access to files outside the intended operational scope. | [1]https://github.com/sylphxltd/filesystem-mcp<br>[2]https://github.com/sylphxltd/filesystem-mcp/issues/134 |

| 55 | CVE-2025-69222 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | LibreChat is a ChatGPT clone with additional features. Version 0.8.1-rc2 is prone to a server-side request forgery (SSRF)vulnerability due to missing restrictions of the Actions feature in the default configuration. LibreChat enables users to configure agents with predefined instructions and actions that can interact with remote services via OpenAPI specifications, supporting various HTTP methods, parameters, and authentication methods including custom headers. By default, there are no restrictions on accessible services, which means agents can also access internal components like the RAG API included in the default Docker Compose setup.

| 56 | CVE-2025-69263 | 7.5  | HIGH | pnpm is a package manager. Versions 10.26.2 and below store HTTP tarball dependencies (and git-hosted tarballs) in the lockfile without integrity hashes. This allows the remote server to serve different content on each install, even when a lockfile is committed. An attacker who publishes a package with an HTTP tarball dependency can serve different code to different users or CI/CD environments. The attack requires the victim to install a package that has an HTTP/git tarball in its dependency tree. The victim`s lockfile provides no protection. This issue is fixed in version 10.26.0. | [1]https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/commit/0958027f88a99ccefe7e9676cdebba393dfbdc85<br>[2]https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/security/advisories/GHSA-7vhp-vf5g-r2fw |
| 57 | CVE-2025-69264 | 8.8  | HIGH | pnpm is a package manager. Versions 10.0.0 through 10.25 allow git-hosted dependencies to execute arbitrary code during pnpm install, circumventing the v10 security feature "Dependency lifecycle scripts execution disabled by default". While pnpm v10 blocks postinstall scripts via the onlyBuiltDependencies mechanism, git dependencies can still execute prepare, prepublish, and prepack scripts during the fetch phase, enabling remote code execution without user consent or approval.
