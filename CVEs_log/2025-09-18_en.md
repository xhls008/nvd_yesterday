| 1 | CVE-2025-10143 | 7.5  | HIGH | The Catch Dark Mode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 2.0 via the `catch_dark_mode` shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary .php files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where .php file types can be uploaded and included. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/catch-dark-mode/trunk/plugin.php#L483<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3359058/<br>[3]https://wordpress.org/plugins/catch-dark-mode<br>[4]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/46776cd5-5262-46ea-b56c-0cbf2b9ae43d?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2025-10589 | 8.8  | HIGH | The N-Reporter, N-Cloud, and N-Probe developed by N-Partner has an OS Command Injection vulnerability, allowing authenticated remote attackers to inject arbitrary OS commands and execute them on the server. | [1]https://www.twcert.org.tw/en/cp-139-10387-b8a4e-2.html<br>[2]https://www.twcert.org.tw/tw/cp-132-10386-231ae-1.html |
| 3 | CVE-2025-58116 | 7.2  | HIGH | Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command (`OS Command Injection`) issue exists in WN-7D36QR and WN-7D36QR/UE.

| 31 | CVE-2025-59340 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | jinjava is a Java-based template engine based on django template syntax, adapted to render jinja templates. Priori to 2.8.1, by using mapper.getTypeFactory().constructFromCanonical(), it is possible to instruct the underlying ObjectMapper to deserialize attacker-controlled input into arbitrary classes. This enables the creation of semi-arbitrary class instances without directly invoking restricted methods or class literals. As a result, an attacker can escape the sandbox and instantiate classes such as java.net.URL, opening up the ability to access local files and URLs(e.g., file:///etc/passwd). With further chaining, this primitive can potentially lead to remote code execution (RCE). This vulnerability is fixed in 2.8.1. | [1]https://github.com/HubSpot/jinjava/commit/66df351e7e8ad71ca04dcacb4b65782af820b8b1<br>[2]https://github.com/HubSpot/jinjava/releases/tag/jinjava-2.8.1<br>[3]https://github.com/HubSpot/jinjava/security/advisories/GHSA-m49c-g9wr-hv6v |
