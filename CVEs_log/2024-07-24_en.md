| 11 | CVE-2024-41655 | 7.5  | HIGH | TF2 Item Format helps users format TF2 items to the community standards. Versions of `tf2-item-format` since at least `4.2.6`  and prior to `5.9.14` are vulnerable to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack when parsing crafted user input. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to perform DoS attacks on any service that uses any `tf2-item-format` to parse user input. Version `5.9.14` contains a fix for the issue. | [1]https://github.com/danocmx/node-tf2-item-format/commit/5cffcc16a9261d6a937bda72bfe6830e02e31eec<br>[2]https://github.com/danocmx/node-tf2-item-format/releases/tag/v5.9.14<br>[3]https://github.com/danocmx/node-tf2-item-format/security/advisories/GHSA-8h55-q5qq-p685 |

| 14 | CVE-2020-11639 | 7.8  | HIGH | An attacker could exploit the vulnerability byinjecting garbage data or specially crafted data. Depending on the data injected each process might beaffected differently. The process could crash or cause communication issues on the affected node, effectively causing a denial-of-service attack. The attacker could tamper with the data transmitted, causingthe product to store wrong information or act on wrong data or display wrong information.This issue affects Advant MOD 300 AdvaBuild: from 3.0 through 3.7 SP2.For an attack to be successful, the attacker must have local access to a node in the system and be able tostart a specially crafted application that disrupts the communication.An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability would be able to manipulate the data in suchway as allowing reads and writes to the controllers or cause Windows processes in 800xA for MOD 300and AdvaBuild to crash. | [1]https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=3BUA003421&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch&_ga=2.200044199.882581162.1721753430-284724496.1718609177 |
| 15 | CVE-2020-11640 | 8.8  | HIGH | AdvaBuild uses a command queue to launch certain operations. An attacker who gains access to thecommand queue can use it to launch an attack by running any executable on the AdvaBuild node. Theexecutables that can be run are not limited to AdvaBuild specific executables.Â Improper Privilege Management vulnerability in ABB Advant MOD 300 AdvaBuild.This issue affects Advant MOD 300 AdvaBuild: from 3.0 through 3.7 SP2. | [1]https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=3BUA003421&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch&_ga=2.200044199.882581162.1721753430-284724496.1718609177 |
| 16 | CVE-2024-41661 | 8.8  | HIGH | reNgine is an automated reconnaissance framework for web applications. In versions 1.2.0 through 2.1.1, an authenticated command injection vulnerability in the WAF detection tool allows an authenticated attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands as root user. The URL query parameter `url` is passed to `subprocess.check_output` without any sanitization, resulting in a command injection vulnerability. This API endpoint is accessible by authenticated users with any use role. Because the process runs as `root`, an attacker has root access. Commit edd3c85ee16f93804ad38dac5602549d2d30a93e contains a patch for the issue. | [1]https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine/blob/53d9f505f04861a5040195ea71f20907ff90577a/web/api/views.py#L268-L275<br>[2]https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine/commit/3d5f1724dd12cf9861443742e7d7c02ff8c75a6f<br>[3]https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine/commit/edd3c85ee16f93804ad38dac5602549d2d30a93e<br>[4]https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine/security/advisories/GHSA-fx7f-f735-vgh4 |
| 17 | CVE-2024-41668 | 8.3  | HIGH | The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics provides visualization, analysis, and download of large-scale cancer genomics data sets. When running a publicly exposed proxy endpoint without authentication, cBioPortal could allow someone to perform a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack. Logged in users could do the same on private instances. A fix has been released in version 6.0.12. As a workaround, one might be able to disable `/proxy` endpoint entirely via, for example, nginx. | [1]https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/commit/ea8642fdbda2d61d2ab34b9da7a1594680bbbcd5<br>[2]https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/pull/10884<br>[3]https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/releases/tag/v6.0.12<br>[4]https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/security/advisories/GHSA-9h44-r3c3-q7rm<br>[5]https://www.wizlynxgroup.com/security-research-advisories/vuln/WLX-2024-004 |
| 18 | CVE-2024-0981 | 7.1  | HIGH | Okta Browser Plugin versions 6.5.0 through 6.31.0 (Chrome/Edge/Firefox/Safari) are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This issue occurs when the plugin prompts the user to save these credentials within Okta Personal. A fix was implemented to properly escape these fields, addressing the vulnerability. Importantly, if Okta Personal is not added to the plugin to enable multi-account view, the Workforce Identity Cloud plugin is not affected by this issue. The vulnerability is fixed in Okta Browser Plugin version 6.32.0 for Chrome/Edge/Safari/Firefox. | [1]https://trust.okta.com/security-advisories/okta-browser-plugin-reflected-cross-site-scripting-cve-2024-0981 |

| 21 | CVE-2024-41656 | 7.1  | HIGH | Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Starting in version 10.0.0 and prior to version 24.7.1, an unsanitized payload sent by an Integration platform integration allows storing arbitrary HTML tags on the Sentry side with the subsequent rendering them on the Issues page. Self-hosted Sentry users may be impacted in case of untrustworthy Integration platform integrations sending external issues from their side to Sentry. A patch has been released in Sentry 24.7.1. For Sentry SaaS customers, no action is needed. This has been patched on July 23, and even prior to the fix, the exploitation was not possible due to the strict Content Security Policy deployed on sentry.io site. For self-hosted users, the maintainers of Sentry strongly recommend upgrading Sentry to the latest version. If it is not possible, one could enable CSP on one`s self-hosted installation with `CSP_REPORT_ONLY = False` (enforcing mode). This will mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting. | [1]https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/tag/24.7.1<br>[2]https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/5c679521f1539eabfb81287bfc30f34dbecd373e<br>[3]https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/74648<br>[4]https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/security/advisories/GHSA-fm88-hc3v-3www |
