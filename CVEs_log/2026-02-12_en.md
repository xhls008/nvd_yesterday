| 1 | CVE-2025-14541 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Lucky Wheel Giveaway plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.22 via the conditional_tags parameter. This is due to the plugin using PHP`s eval() function on user-controlled input without proper validation or sanitization. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to execute code on the server. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3439141/wp-lucky-wheel/trunk<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/ac0455a2-1fa8-4a37-a72f-9ed5cca1d9ee?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2026-1357 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Migration, Backup, Staging – WPvivid Backup & Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload in versions up to and including 0.9.123. This is due to improper error handling in the RSA decryption process combined with a lack of path sanitization when writing uploaded files. When the plugin fails to decrypt a session key using openssl_private_decrypt(), it does not terminate execution and instead passes the boolean false value to the phpseclib library`s AES cipher initialization. The library treats this false value as a string of null bytes, allowing an attacker to encrypt a malicious payload using a predictable null-byte key. Additionally, the plugin accepts filenames from the decrypted payload without sanitization, enabling directory traversal to escape the protected backup directory. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary PHP files to publicly accessible directories and achieve Remote Code Execution via the wpvivid_action=send_to_site parameter. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpvivid-backuprestore/tags/0.9.122/includes/class-wpvivid-crypt.php#L58<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpvivid-backuprestore/tags/0.9.122/includes/customclass/class-wpvivid-send-to-site.php#L629<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpvivid-backuprestore/tags/0.9.123/includes/class-wpvivid-crypt.php#L58<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpvivid-backuprestore/tags/0.9.123/includes/customclass/class-wpvivid-send-to-site.php#L629<br>[5]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpvivid-backuprestore/trunk/includes/class-wpvivid-crypt.php#L58<br>[6]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpvivid-backuprestore/trunk/includes/customclass/class-wpvivid-send-to-site.php#L629<br>[7]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3448386/wpvivid-backuprestore#file1<br>[8]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e5af0317-ef46-4744-9752-74ce228b5f37?source=cve |

| 38 | CVE-2026-2360 | 8.0  | HIGH | PostgreSQL Anonymizer contains a vulnerability that allows a user to gain superuser privileges by creating a custom operator in the public schema and place malicious code in that operator. This operator will later be executed with superuser privileges when the extension is created. The risk is higher with PostgreSQL 14 or with instances upgraded from PostgreSQL 14 or a prior version. With PostgreSQL 15 and later, the creation permission on the public schema is revoked by default and this exploit can only be achieved if a superuser adds a new schema in her/his own search_path and grants the CREATE privilege on that schema to untrusted users, both actions being clearly discouraged by the PostgreSQL documentation. The problem is resolved in PostgreSQL Anonymizer 3.0.1 and further versions | [1]https://gitlab.com/dalibo/postgresql_anonymizer/-/blob/latest/NEWS.md<br>[2]https://gitlab.com/dalibo/postgresql_anonymizer/-/issues/616<br>[3]https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-schemas.html#DDL-SCHEMAS-PATH |
| 39 | CVE-2026-2361 | 8.0  | HIGH | PostgreSQL Anonymizer contains a vulnerability that allows a user to gain superuser privileges by creating a temporary view based on a function containing malicious code. When the anon.get_tablesample_ratio function is then called, the malicious code is executed with superuser privileges. This privilege elevation can be exploited by users having the CREATE privilege in PostgreSQL 15 and later. The risk is higher with PostgreSQL 14 or with instances upgraded from PostgreSQL 14 or a prior version because the creation permission on the public schema is granted by default.

| 92 | CVE-2026-26158 | 7.0  | HIGH | A flaw was found in BusyBox. This vulnerability allows an attacker to modify files outside of the intended extraction directory by crafting a malicious tar archive containing unvalidated hardlink or symlink entries. If the tar archive is extracted with elevated privileges, this flaw can lead to privilege escalation, enabling an attacker to gain unauthorized access to critical system files. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2026-26158<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2439040<br>[3]https://git.busybox.net/busybox/commit/archival?id=3fb6b31c716669e12f75a2accd31bb7685b1a1cb |
| 93 | CVE-2026-26029 | 7.5  | HIGH | sf-mcp-server is an implementation of Salesforce MCP server for Claude for Desktop. A command injection vulnerability exists in sf-mcp-server due to unsafe use of child_process.exec when constructing Salesforce CLI commands with user-controlled input. Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the MCP server process. | [1]https://github.com/akutishevsky/sf-mcp-server/commit/99fba0171b8c22b5ee3c0405053ccfd2910a066d<br>[2]https://github.com/akutishevsky/sf-mcp-server/security/advisories/GHSA-h4w9-g9c5-vfwq |
