| 23 | CVE-2025-30661 | 7.3  | HIGH | An Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource vulnerability in line card script processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows a local, low-privileged user to install scripts to be executed as root, leading to privilege escalation.A local user with access to the local file system can copy a script to the router in a way that will be executed as root, as the system boots. Execution of the script as root can lead to privilege escalation, potentially providing the adversary complete control of the system.This issue only affects specific line cards, such as the MPC10, MPC11, LC4800, LC9600, MX304-LMIC16, SRX4700, and EX9200-15C.This issue affects Junos OS:  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S4,   *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S5,   *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2-S1,   *  from 24.4 before 24.4R1-S3, 24.4R2.This issue does not affect versions prior to 23.1R2. | [1]https://github.com/orangecertcc/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-2p66-9j7x-fmch<br>[2]https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA100057 |
| 24 | CVE-2025-52946 | 7.5  | HIGH | A Use After Free vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker sending a BGP update with a specifically malformed AS PATH to cause rpd to crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Continuous receipt of the malformed AS PATH attribute will cause a sustained DoS condition.On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms, the rpd process will crash and restart when a specifically malformed AS PATH is received within a BGP update and traceoptions are enabled.This issue only affects systems with BGP traceoptions enabled and requires a BGP session to be already established.  Systems without BGP traceoptions enabled are not impacted by this issue.This issue affects: Junos OS:  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9,   *  all versions of 21.4,  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S6,   *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S5,   *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3,   *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S4,   *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2; Junos OS Evolved:   *  All versions before 22.4R3-S5-EVO,   *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S3-EVO,   *  from 23.4-EVO before 23.4R2-S4-EVO,   *  from 24.2-EVO before 24.2R2-EVO.This is a more complete fix for previously published CVE-2024-39549 (JSA83011). | [1]https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA100050 |
| 25 | CVE-2025-52950 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | A Missing Authorization vulnerability in Juniper Networks Security Director allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to read or tamper with multiple sensitive resources via the web interface.Numerous endpoints on the Juniper Security Director appliance do not validate authorization and will deliver information to the caller that is outside their authorization level. An attacker can access data that is outside the user`s authorization level. The information obtained can be used to gain access to additional information or perpetrate other attacks, impacting downstream managed devices.This issue affects Security Director version 24.4.1. | [1]https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA100054 |
| 26 | CVE-2025-52954 | 7.8  | HIGH | A Missing Authorization vulnerability in the internal virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows a local, low-privileged user to gain root privileges, leading to a system compromise.Any low-privileged user with the capability to send packets over the internal VRF can execute arbitrary Junos commands and modify the configuration, and thus compromise the system. This issue affects Junos OS Evolved:   *  All versions before 22.2R3-S7-EVO,   *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S7-EVO,   *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S4-EVO,   *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S5-EVO,   *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2-S1-EVO  *  from 24.4 before 24.4R1-S2-EVO, 24.4R2-EVO. | [1]https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA100060 |
| 27 | CVE-2025-52980 | 7.5  | HIGH | A Use of Incorrect Byte Ordering vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX300 Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).When a BGP update is received over an established BGP session which contains a specific, valid, optional, transitive path attribute, rpd will crash and restart.This issue affects eBGP and iBGP over IPv4 and IPv6.This issue affects:Junos OS:  *  22.1 versions from 22.1R1 before 22.2R3-S4,  *  22.3 versions before 22.3R3-S3,  *  22.4 versions before 22.4R3-S2,  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2,  *  23.4 versions before 23.4R2. | [1]https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA100084 |
