| 20 | CVE-2024-8285 | 7.3  | HIGH | A flaw was found in Kroxylicious. When establishing the connection with the upstream Kafka server using a TLS secured connection, Kroxylicious fails to properly verify the server`s hostname, resulting in an insecure connection. For a successful attack to be performed, the attacker needs to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack or compromise any external systems, such as DNS or network routing configuration. This issue is considered a high complexity attack, with additional high privileges required, as the attack would need access to the Kroxylicious configuration or a peer system. The result of a successful attack impacts both data integrity and confidentiality. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-8285<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2308606 |
