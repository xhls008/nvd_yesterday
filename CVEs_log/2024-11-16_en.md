| 1 | CVE-2024-11120 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | Certain EOL GeoVision devices have an OS Command Injection vulnerability. Unauthenticated remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability to inject and execute arbitrary system commands on the device. Moreover, this vulnerability has already been exploited by attackers, and we have received related reports. | [1]https://www.twcert.org.tw/en/cp-139-8237-26d7a-2.html<br>[2]https://www.twcert.org.tw/tw/cp-132-8236-d4836-1.html |
| 2 | CVE-2024-10924 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Really Simple Security (Free, Pro, and Pro Multisite) plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions 9.0.0 to 9.1.1.1. This is due to improper user check error handling in the two-factor REST API actions with the `check_login_and_get_user` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, when the "Two-Factor Authentication" setting is enabled (disabled by default). | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/really-simple-ssl/tags/9.1.1.1/security/wordpress/two-fa/class-rsssl-two-factor-on-board-api.php#L277<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/really-simple-ssl/tags/9.1.1.1/security/wordpress/two-fa/class-rsssl-two-factor-on-board-api.php#L278<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/really-simple-ssl/tags/9.1.1.1/security/wordpress/two-fa/class-rsssl-two-factor-on-board-api.php#L67<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3188431/really-simple-ssl<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/7d5d05ad-1a7a-43d2-bbbf-597e975446be?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2024-10260 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Tripetto plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 8.0.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the file. | [1]https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/tripetto/trunk/lib/attachments.php<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/3718c252-2ca3-4f7d-b43a-3c1b2e6b34c0?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2024-10793 | 7.2  | HIGH | The WP Activity Log plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the user_id parameter in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever an administrative user accesses an injected page. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-security-audit-log/tags/5.2.1/classes/WPSensors/class-wp-system-sensor.php#L679<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/44f3b2e4-c537-4369-b2d6-39fbc6cb8e08?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2024-45784 | 7.5  | HIGH | Apache Airflow versions before 2.10.3 contain a vulnerability that could expose sensitive configuration variables in task logs. This vulnerability allows DAG authors to unintentionally or intentionally log sensitive configuration variables. Unauthorized users could access these logs, potentially exposing critical data that could be exploited to compromise the security of the Airflow deployment. In version 2.10.3, secrets are now masked in task logs to prevent sensitive configuration variables from being exposed in the logging output. Users should upgrade to Airflow 2.10.3 or the latest version to eliminate this vulnerability. If you suspect that DAG authors could have logged the secret values to the logs and that your logs are not additionally protected, it is also recommended that you update those secrets. | [1]https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/43040<br>[2]https://lists.apache.org/thread/k2jm55jztlbmk4zrlh10syvq3n57hl4h |
| 6 | CVE-2024-10311 | 7.5  | HIGH | The External Database Based Actions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 0.1.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to extract sensitive data including usernames and passwords of any user, including Administrators, as long as that user opens the email notification for a password change request and images are not blocked by the email client. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/essential-addons-for-elementor-lite/trunk/includes/Elements/Login_Register.php#L2440<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3188634/<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/34d09086-be33-40cf-b5bf-d6c03cf0b68a?source=cve |
| 8 | CVE-2022-1884 | 10.0  | CRITICAL | A remote command execution vulnerability exists in gogs/gogs versions <=0.12.7 when deployed on a Windows server. The vulnerability arises due to improper validation of the `tree_path` parameter during file uploads. An attacker can set `tree_path=.git.` to upload a file into the .git directory, allowing them to write or rewrite the `.git/config` file. If the `core.sshCommand` is set, this can lead to remote command execution. | [1]https://huntr.com/bounties/9cd4e7b7-0979-4e5e-9a1c-388b58dea76b |
