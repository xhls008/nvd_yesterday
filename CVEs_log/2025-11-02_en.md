|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2025-11920 | 8.8  | HIGH | The WPCOM Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.14 via the action parameter in one of its shortcodes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary .php files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where .php file types can be uploaded and included. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpcom-member/tags/1.7.13/includes/class-member.php#L1119<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpcom-member/tags/1.7.13/includes/class-member.php#L1171<br>[3]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpcom-member/tags/1.7.13/includes/class-member.php#L374<br>[4]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3385562/wpcom-member/trunk<br>[5]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/43b04825-d1c6-4e2a-9035-1f4fbfe14818?source=cve |
| 2 | CVE-2025-11833 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Post SMTP – Complete SMTP Solution with Logs, Alerts, Backup SMTP & Mobile App plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the __construct function in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary logged emails sent through the Post SMTP plugin, including password reset emails containing password reset links, which can lead to account takeover. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/post-smtp/tags/3.5.0/Postman/PostmanEmailLogs.php#L51<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3386160/post-smtp<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/491f44fc-712c-4f67-b5c2-a7396941afc1?source=cve |
| 3 | CVE-2025-11995 | 7.2  | HIGH | The Community Events plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via event details parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/community-events/trunk/community-events.php?rev=3115223<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3384504%40community-events&new=3384504%40community-events&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6c12bcf6-6297-457a-a807-28f5dbacb0eb?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2025-5949 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Service Finder Bookings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 6.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user`s identity prior to processing a password change request. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber access or higher to reset other users` passwords, including those of admins. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/service-finder-service-and-business-listing-wordpress-theme/15208793<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/a2874a5f-71f4-4bcd-87e8-a20bb19a5847?source=cve |
| 5 | CVE-2025-10487 | 7.3  | HIGH | The Advanced Ads – Ad Manager & AdSense plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.12 via the select_one() function. This is due to the endpoint not properly restricting access to the AJAX endpoint or limiting the functions that can be called to safe functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to call arbitrary functions beginning with get_the_ like get_the_excerpt which can make information exposure possible. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3381123%40advanced-ads&new=3381123%40advanced-ads&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/3efe6b81-72db-4419-92a3-26e22ebf46e8?source=cve |
| 6 | CVE-2025-11499 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Tablesome Table – Contact Form DB – WPForms, CF7, Gravity, Forminator, Fluent plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the set_featured_image_from_external_url() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.32. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible in configurations where unauthenticated users have been provided with a method for adding featured images, and the workflow trigger is created. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tablesome/trunk/workflow-library/actions/wp-post-creation.php#L309<br>[2]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3386484/tablesome/trunk/workflow-library/actions/wp-post-creation.php<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/2be770c7-7aa2-430b-981d-5d81fe068bef?source=cve |
| 7 | CVE-2025-11755 | 8.8  | HIGH | The WP Delicious – Recipe Plugin for Food Bloggers (formerly Delicious Recipes) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads when importing recipes via CSV in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.0. This flaw allows an attacker with at least Contributor-level permissions to upload a malicious PHP file by providing a remote URL during a recipe import process, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE). | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/delicious-recipes/trunk/src/api/inc/endpoints/class-delicious-recipes-rest-import-recipe-terms-controller.php<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/603210ca-7231-4c91-8258-fe3cd6e37425?source=cve |
| 8 | CVE-2025-12171 | 8.8  | HIGH | The RESTful Content Syndication plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ingest_image() function in versions 1.1.0 to 1.5.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. This requires the attacker have access to a defined third-party server as specified in the settings, so it is unlikely that this will be exploitable by contributor-level users, and more likely to be exploited by administrators who also have access to the plugin`s settings. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3384901%40restful-syndication&new=3384901%40restful-syndication&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/99db7ac5-b7ac-4a4f-bd05-e563a3dfb839?source=cve |
| 9 | CVE-2025-6574 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Service Finder Bookings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and excluding, 6.1. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user`s identity prior to updating their details like email. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to change arbitrary user`s email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user`s password and gain access to their account. | [1]https://themeforest.net/item/service-finder-service-and-business-listing-wordpress-theme/15208793<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/264cb002-bf40-4cc2-9c21-cda9bb24f494?source=cve |
| 10 | CVE-2025-6990 | 8.8  | HIGH | The kallyas theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 4.24.0 via the  `TH_PhpCode` pagebuilder widget. This is due to the theme not restricting access to the code editor widget for non-administrators. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to execute code on the server. | [1]https://my.hogash.com/changelog_category/kallyas-wordpress-theme/<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/721d29e4-397d-4965-bd64-33bced8e5de4?source=cve |
| 11 | CVE-2025-36367 | 8.8  | HIGH | IBM i 7.6, 7.5, 7.4, 7.3, and 7.2 is vulnerable to privilege escalation caused by an invalid IBM i SQL services authorization check. A malicious actor can use the elevated privileges of another user profile to gain root access to the host operating system. | [1]https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/7249915 |
