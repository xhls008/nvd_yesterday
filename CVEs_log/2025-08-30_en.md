| 4 | CVE-2025-40927 | 7.3  | HIGH | CGI::Simple versions before 1.282 for Perl has a HTTP response splitting flawThis vulnerability is a confirmed HTTP response splitting flaw in CGI::Simple that allows HTTP response header injection, which can be used for reflected XSS or open redirect under certain conditions.Although some validation exists, it can be bypassed using URL-encoded values, allowing an attacker to inject untrusted content into the response via query parameters.As a result, an attacker can inject a line break (e.g. %0A) into the parameter value, causing the server to split the HTTP response and inject arbitrary headers or even an HTML/JavaScript body, leading to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS), open redirect or other attacks.The issue documented in CVE-2010-4410 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-4410 is related but the fix was incomplete.ImpactBy injecting %0A (newline) into a query string parameter, an attacker can:  *  Break the current HTTP header  *  Inject a new header or entire body  *  Deliver a script payload that is reflected in the server’s responseThat can lead to the following attacks:  *  reflected XSS  *  open redirect  *  cache poisoning  *  header manipulation | [1]https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2004-2320<br>[2]https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-3<br>[3]https://metacpan.org/release/MANWAR/CGI-Simple-1.281/diff/MANWAR/CGI-Simple-1.282/lib/CGI/Simple.pm<br>[4]https://metacpan.org/release/MANWAR/CGI-Simple-1.281/source/lib/CGI/Simple.pm#L1031-1035<br>[5]https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/HTTP_Response_Splitting<br>[6]https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=21951 |
