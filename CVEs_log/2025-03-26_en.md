| 33 | CVE-2025-30216 | 9.4  | CRITICAL | CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. In versions 1.3.3 and prior, a Heap Overflow vulnerability occurs in the `Crypto_TM_ProcessSecurity` function (`crypto_tm.c:1735:8`). When processing the Secondary Header Length of a TM protocol packet, if the Secondary Header Length exceeds the packet`s total length, a heap overflow is triggered during the memcpy operation that copies packet data into the dynamically allocated buffer `p_new_dec_frame`. This allows an attacker to overwrite adjacent heap memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or system instability. A patch is available at commit 810fd66d592c883125272fef123c3240db2f170f. | [1]https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/commit/810fd66d592c883125272fef123c3240db2f170f<br>[2]https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-v3jc-5j74-hcjv<br>[3]https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d49cea04-ce84-4d60-bb3a-987e843f09c4 |
