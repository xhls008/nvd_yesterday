| 1 | CVE-2024-43369 | 7.2  | HIGH | Ibexa RichText Field Type is a Field Type for supporting rich formatted text stored in a structured XML format. In versions on the 4.6 branch prior to 4.6.10, the validator for the RichText fieldtype blocklists `javascript:` and `vbscript:` in links to prevent XSS. This can leave other options open, and the check can be circumvented using upper case. Content editing permissions for RichText content is required to exploit this vulnerability, which typically means Editor role or higher. The fix implements an allowlist instead, which allows only approved link protocols. The new check is case insensitive. Version 4.6.10 contains a patch for this issue. No known workarounds are available. | [1]https://developers.ibexa.co/security-advisories/ibexa-sa-2024-005-persistent-xss-in-richtext<br>[2]https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform-richtext/security/advisories/GHSA-rhm7-7469-rcpw<br>[3]https://github.com/ibexa/fieldtype-richtext/commit/0a3b830e8806d5169f697351fdc48ffd95a25c67<br>[4]https://github.com/ibexa/fieldtype-richtext/commit/59e9c1a9da60597f60cf7338bf289dccaa7e27ca<br>[5]https://github.com/ibexa/fieldtype-richtext/security/advisories/GHSA-hvcf-6324-cjh7 |
| 2 | CVE-2024-43370 | 7.2  | HIGH | gettext.js is a GNU gettext port for node and the browser. There is a cross-site scripting (XSS) injection if `.po` dictionary definition files are corrupted. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.0.3. As a workaround, control the origin of the definition catalog to prevent the use of this flaw in the definition of plural forms. | [1]https://github.com/guillaumepotier/gettext.js/commit/8150aeba833183e14c2291a8a148b8f79d1d68d8<br>[2]https://github.com/guillaumepotier/gettext.js/security/advisories/GHSA-vwhg-jwr4-vxgg |
| 3 | CVE-2024-43378 | 7.8  | HIGH | calamares-nixos-extensions provides Calamares branding and modules for NixOS, a distribution of GNU/Linux. Users who installed NixOS through the graphical installer who used manual disk partitioning to create a setup where the system was booted via legacy BIOS rather than UEFI; some disk partitions are encrypted; but the partitions containing either `/` or `/boot` are unencrypted; have their LUKS disk encryption key file in plain text either in `/crypto_keyfile.bin`, or in a CPIO archive attached to their NixOS initrd. `nixos-install` is not affected, nor are UEFI installations, nor was the default automatic partitioning configuration on legacy BIOS systems. The problem has been fixed in calamares-nixos-extensions 0.3.17, which was included in NixOS. The current installer images for the NixOS 24.05 and unstable (24.11) channels are unaffected. The fix reached 24.05 at 2024-08-13 20:06:59 UTC, and unstable at 2024-08-15 09:00:20 UTC. Installer images downloaded before those times may be vulnerable. The best solution for affected users is probably to back up their data and do a complete reinstallation. However, the mitigation procedure in GHSA-3rvf-24q2-24ww should work solely for the case where `/` is encrypted but `/boot` is not. If `/` is unencrypted, then the `/crypto_keyfile.bin` file will need to be deleted in addition to the remediation steps in the previous advisory. This issue is a partial regression of CVE-2023-36476 / GHSA-3rvf-24q2-24ww, which was more severe as it applied to the default configuration on BIOS systems. | [1]https://github.com/NixOS/calamares-nixos-extensions/pull/43<br>[2]https://github.com/NixOS/calamares-nixos-extensions/security/advisories/GHSA-3rvf-24q2-24ww<br>[3]https://github.com/NixOS/calamares-nixos-extensions/security/advisories/GHSA-vfxf-gpmj-2p25<br>[4]https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/331607<br>[5]https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/334252 |
| 4 | CVE-2024-7849 | 8.8  | HIGH | ** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in D-Link DNS-120, DNR-202L, DNS-315L, DNS-320, DNS-320L, DNS-320LW, DNS-321, DNR-322L, DNS-323, DNS-325, DNS-326, DNS-327L, DNR-326, DNS-340L, DNS-343, DNS-345, DNS-726-4, DNS-1100-4, DNS-1200-05 and DNS-1550-04 up to 20240814. This affects the function cgi_create_album of the file /cgi-bin/photocenter_mgr.cgi. The manipulation of the argument current_path leads to buffer overflow. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. NOTE: Vendor was contacted early and confirmed that the product is end-of-life. It should be retired and replaced. | [1]https://github.com/BuaaIOTTeam/Iot_Dlink_NAS/blob/main/DNS_cgi_create_album.md<br>[2]https://supportannouncement.us.dlink.com/security/publication.aspx?name=SAP10383<br>[3]https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.274755<br>[4]https://vuldb.com/?id.274755<br>[5]https://vuldb.com/?submit.390113 |
