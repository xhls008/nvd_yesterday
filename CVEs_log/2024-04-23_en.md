The workaround requires server side support. | [1]https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/pull/10077<br>[2]https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/releases/tag/2.11.6<br>[3]https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/releases/tag/3.5.0<br>[4]https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/security/advisories/GHSA-4rr8-gr65-vqrr |
| 12 | CVE-2024-32461 | 7.1  | HIGH | LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. A SQL injection vulnerability in POST /search/search=packages in LibreNMS prior to version 24.4.0 allows a user with global read privileges to execute SQL commands via the package parameter. With this vulnerability, an attacker can exploit a SQL injection time based vulnerability to extract all data from the database, such as administrator credentials. Version 24.4.0 contains a patch for the vulnerability. | [1]https://doc.clickup.com/9013166444/p/h/8ckm0bc-53/16811991bb5fff6<br>[2]https://github.com/librenms/librenms/commit/d29201fce134347f891102699fbde7070debee33<br>[3]https://github.com/librenms/librenms/security/advisories/GHSA-cwx6-cx7x-4q34 |
| 13 | CVE-2024-32479 | 7.1  | HIGH | LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. Prior to version 24.4.0, there is improper sanitization on the `Service` template name, which can lead to stored Cross-site Scripting. Version 24.4.0 fixes this vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/librenms/librenms/blob/a61c11db7e8ef6a437ab55741658be2be7d14d34/app/Http/Controllers/ServiceTemplateController.php#L67C23-L67C23<br>[2]https://github.com/librenms/librenms/commit/19344f0584d4d6d4526fdf331adc60530e3f685b<br>[3]https://github.com/librenms/librenms/security/advisories/GHSA-72m9-7c8x-pmmw |
| 14 | CVE-2024-32480 | 7.2  | HIGH | LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. Versions prior to 24.4.0 are vulnerable to SQL injection. The `order` parameter is obtained from `$request`. After performing a string check, the value is directly incorporated into an SQL statement and concatenated, resulting in a SQL injection vulnerability. An attacker may extract a whole database this way. Version 24.4.0 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/librenms/librenms/commit/83fe4b10c440d69a47fe2f8616e290ba2bd3a27c<br>[2]https://github.com/librenms/librenms/security/advisories/GHSA-jh57-j3vq-h438 |
| 15 | CVE-2024-32656 | 7.8  | HIGH | Ant Media Server is live streaming engine software. A local privilege escalation vulnerability in present in versions 2.6.0 through 2.8.2 allows any unprivileged operating system user account to escalate privileges to the root user account on the system. This vulnerability arises from Ant Media Server running with Java Management Extensions (JMX) enabled and authentication disabled on localhost on port 5599/TCP. This vulnerability is nearly identical to the local privilege escalation vulnerability CVE-2023-26269 identified in Apache James. Any unprivileged operating system user can connect to the JMX service running on port 5599/TCP on localhost and leverage the MLet Bean within JMX to load a remote MBean from an attacker-controlled server. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the Java process run by Ant Media Server and execute code within the context of the `antmedia` service account on the system. Version 2.9.0 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may remove certain parameters from the `antmedia.service` file. | [1]https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/commit/9cb38500729e0ff302da0290b9cfe1ec4dd6c764<br>[2]https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/security/advisories/GHSA-qwhw-hh9j-54f5 |
