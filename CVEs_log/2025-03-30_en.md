|-----|--------|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | CVE-2025-2006 | 8.8  | HIGH | The Inline Image Upload for BBPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the file uploading functionality in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.19. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site`s server which may make remote code execution possible. This may be exploitable by unauthenticated attackers when the "Allow guest users without accounts to create topics and replies" setting is enabled. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/image-upload-for-bbpress/tags/1.1.19/bbp-image-upload.php#L136<br>[2]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/df09af41-399a-4878-8420-721f1198d895?source=cve |

| 3 | CVE-2025-2266 | 9.8  | CRITICAL | The Checkout Mestres do WP for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the cwmpUpdateOptions() function in versions 8.6.5 to 8.7.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site. | [1]https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/checkout-mestres-wp/trunk/backend/core/base/ajax.php#L31<br>[2]https://wordpress.org/plugins/checkout-mestres-wp/<br>[3]https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/9834fd5b-8445-4c6f-95f9-f0df785c65f8?source=cve |
| 4 | CVE-2025-2803 | 7.3  | HIGH | The So-Called Air Quotes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 0.1.
