| 95 | CVE-2025-53372 | 7.5  | HIGH | node-code-sandbox-mcp is a Node.js–based Model Context Protocol server that spins up disposable Docker containers to execute arbitrary JavaScript. Prior to 1.3.0, a command injection vulnerability exists in the node-code-sandbox-mcp MCP Server. The vulnerability is caused by the unsanitized use of input parameters within a call to child_process.execSync, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the server process`s privileges on the host machine, bypassing the sandbox protection of running code inside docker. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.3.0. | [1]https://github.com/alfonsograziano/node-code-sandbox-mcp/commit/e461a74ecb189b268daac0d972c467b49b2abdd2<br>[2]https://github.com/alfonsograziano/node-code-sandbox-mcp/security/advisories/GHSA-5w57-2ccq-8w95<br>[3]https://github.com/alfonsograziano/node-code-sandbox-mcp/security/advisories/GHSA-5w57-2ccq-8w95 |

| 210 | CVE-2025-48384 | 8.0  | HIGH | Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When reading a config value, Git strips any trailing carriage return and line feed (CRLF). When writing a config entry, values with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be lost when the config is later read. When initializing a submodule, if the submodule path contains a trailing CR, the altered path is read resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect location. If a symlink exists that points the altered path to the submodule hooks directory, and the submodule contains an executable post-checkout hook, the script may be unintentionally executed after checkout. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1. | [1]https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-vwqx-4fm8-6qc9 |

| 238 | CVE-2025-53547 | 8.5  | HIGH | Helm is a package manager for Charts for Kubernetes. Prior to 3.18.4, a specially crafted Chart.yaml file along with a specially linked Chart.lock file can lead to local code execution when dependencies are updated. Fields in a Chart.yaml file, that are carried over to a Chart.lock file when dependencies are updated and this file is written, can be crafted in a way that can cause execution if that same content were in a file that is executed (e.g., a bash.rc file or shell script). If the Chart.lock file is symlinked to one of these files updating dependencies will write the lock file content to the symlinked file. This can lead to unwanted execution. Helm warns of the symlinked file but did not stop execution due to symlinking. This issue has been resolved in Helm v3.18.4. | [1]https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/4b8e61093d8f579f1165cdc6bd4b43fa5455f571<br>[2]https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-557j-xg8c-q2mm |
