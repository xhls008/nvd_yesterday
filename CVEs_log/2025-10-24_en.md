| 4 | CVE-2025-12105 | 7.5  | HIGH | A flaw was found in the asynchronous message queue handling of the libsoup library, widely used by GNOME and WebKit-based applications to manage HTTP/2 communications. When network operations are aborted at specific timing intervals, an internal message queue item may be freed twice due to missing state synchronization. This leads to a use-after-free memory access, potentially crashing the affected application. Attackers could exploit this behavior remotely by triggering specific HTTP/2 read and cancel sequences, resulting in a denial-of-service condition. | [1]https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-12105<br>[2]https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2405992 |

| 11 | CVE-2025-59048 | 8.1  | HIGH | OpenBao`s AWS Plugin generates AWS access credentials based on IAM policies. Prior to version 0.1.1, the AWS Plugin is vulnerable to cross-account IAM role Impersonation in the AWS auth method. The vulnerability allows an IAM role from an untrusted AWS account to authenticate by impersonating a role with the same name in a trusted account, leading to unauthorized access. This impacts all users of the auth-aws plugin who operate in a multi-account AWS environment where IAM role names may not be unique across accounts. This vulnerability has been patched in version 0.1.1 of the auth-aws plugin. A workaround for this issue involves guaranteeing that IAM role names are unique across all AWS accounts that could potentially interact with your OpenBao environment, and to audit for any duplicate IAM roles. | [1]https://github.com/openbao/openbao-plugins/commit/2a77af36834746ca6d3ac9bd1049154c84b3efae<br>[2]https://github.com/openbao/openbao-plugins/security/advisories/GHSA-jp7h-4f3c-9rc7 |
| 12 | CVE-2025-62169 | 8.1  | HIGH | OctoPrint-SpoolManager is a plugin for managing spools and all their usage metadata. In versions 1.8.0a2 and older of the testing branch and versions 1.7.7 and older of the stable branch, the APIs of the OctoPrint-SpoolManager plugin do not correctly enforce authentication or authorization checks. This issue has been patched in versions 1.8.0a3 of the testing branch and 1.7.8 of the stable branch. The impact of this vulnerability is greatly reduced when using OctoPrint version 1.11.2 and newer. | [1]https://github.com/WildRikku/OctoPrint-SpoolManager/commit/b725e113316e177ce81238a2dbbbdb63d92c40b0<br>[2]https://github.com/WildRikku/OctoPrint-SpoolManager/releases/tag/1.7.8<br>[3]https://github.com/WildRikku/OctoPrint-SpoolManager/releases/tag/1.8.0a3<br>[4]https://github.com/WildRikku/OctoPrint-SpoolManager/security/advisories/GHSA-2rrc-f24f-94f6 |

This vulnerability, CVE-2025-11621, is fixed in Vault Community Edition 1.21.0 and Vault Enterprise 1.21.0, 1.20.5, 1.19.11, and 1.16.27 | [1]https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2025-30-vault-aws-auth-method-authentication-bypass-through-mishandling-of-cache-entries/76709 |
| 14 | CVE-2025-23347 | 7.8  | HIGH | NVIDIA Project G-Assist contains a vulnerability where an attacker might be able to escalate permissions. A successful exploit of this vulnerability might lead to code execution, escalation of privileges, data tampering, denial of service, and information disclosure. | [1]https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-23347<br>[2]https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5703<br>[3]https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23347 |
| 15 | CVE-2025-23352 | 7.8  | HIGH | NVIDIA vGPU software contains a vulnerability in the Virtual GPU Manager, where a malicious guest could cause uninitialized pointer access. A successful exploit of this vulnerability might lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering. | [1]https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-23352<br>[2]https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5703<br>[3]https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-23352 |
| 16 | CVE-2025-54808 | 7.8  | HIGH | Oxford Nanopore Technologies` MinKNOW software at or prior to version 24.11 stores authentication tokens in a file located in the system`s temporary directory (/tmp) on the host machine. This directory is typically world-readable, allowing any local user or application to access the token. If the token is leaked (e.g., via malware infection or other local exploit), and remote access is enabled, it can be used to establish unauthorized remote connections to the sequencer. Remote access must be enabled for remote exploitation to succeed. This may occur either because the user has enabled remote access for legitimate operational reasons or because malware with elevated privileges (e.g., sudo access) enables it without user consent. This vulnerability can be chained with remote access capabilities to generate a developer token from a remote device. Developer tokens can be created with arbitrary expiration dates, enabling persistent access to the sequencer and bypassing standard authentication mechanisms. | [1]https://github.com/cisagov/CSAF/blob/develop/csaf_files/OT/white/2025/icsma-25-294-01.json<br>[2]https://nanoporetech.com/about/contact<br>[3]https://nanoporetech.com/software/<br>[4]https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-medical-advisories/icsma-25-294-01 |
