| 23 | CVE-2025-59152 | 7.5  | HIGH | Litestar is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework. In version 2.17.0, rate limits can be completely bypassed by manipulating the X-Forwarded-For header. This renders IP-based rate limiting ineffective against determined attackers. Litestar`s RateLimitMiddleware uses `cache_key_from_request()` to generate cache keys for rate limiting. When an X-Forwarded-For header is present, the middleware trusts it unconditionally and uses its value as part of the client identifier. Since clients can set arbitrary X-Forwarded-For values, each different spoofed IP creates a separate rate limit bucket. An attacker can rotate through different header values to avoid hitting any single bucket`s limit. This affects any Litestar application using RateLimitMiddleware with default settings, which likely includes most applications that implement rate limiting. Version 2.18.0 contains a patch for the vulnerability. | [1]https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar/blob/26f20ac6c52de2b4bf81161f7560c8bb4af6f382/litestar/middleware/rate_limit.py#L127<br>[2]https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar/commit/42a89e043e50b515f8548a93954fe143f63cf9fb<br>[3]https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar/security/advisories/GHSA-hm36-ffrh-c77c |
| 24 | CVE-2025-59159 | 9.6  | CRITICAL | SillyTavern is a locally installed user interface that allows users to interact with text generation large language models, image generation engines, and text-to-speech voice models. In versions prior to 1.13.4, the web user interface for SillyTavern is susceptible to DNS rebinding, allowing attackers to perform actions like install malicious extensions, read chats, inject arbitrary HTML for phishing attacks, etc. The vulnerability has been patched in the version 1.13.4 by introducing a server configuration setting that enables a validation of host names in inbound HTTP requests according to the provided list of allowed hosts: `hostWhitelist.enabled` in config.yaml file or `SILLYTAVERN_HOSTWHITELIST_ENABLED` environment variable. While the setting is disabled by default to honor a wide variety of existing user configurations and maintain backwards compatibility, existing and new users are encouraged to review their server configurations and apply necessary changes to their setup, especially if hosting over the local network while not using SSL. | [1]https://docs.sillytavern.app/administration/#security-checklist<br>[2]https://docs.sillytavern.app/administration/config-yaml/#host-whitelisting<br>[3]https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern/commit/d134abd50e4a416e3b81233242583b0a23f38320<br>[4]https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern/releases/tag/1.13.4<br>[5]https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern/security/advisories/GHSA-7cxj-w27x-x78q |
| 25 | CVE-2025-61687 | 8.3  | HIGH | Flowise is a drag & drop user interface to build a customized large language model flow. A file upload vulnerability in version 3.0.7 of FlowiseAI allows authenticated users to upload arbitrary files without proper validation. This enables attackers to persistently store malicious Node.js web shells on the server, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The system fails to validate file extensions, MIME types, or file content during uploads. As a result, malicious scripts such as Node.js-based web shells can be uploaded and stored persistently on the server. These shells expose HTTP endpoints capable of executing arbitrary commands if triggered. The uploaded shell does not automatically execute, but its presence allows future exploitation via administrator error or chained vulnerabilities. This presents a high-severity threat to system integrity and confidentiality. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available. | [1]https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/d29db16bfcf9a4be8febc3d19d52263e8c3d0055/packages/components/src/storageUtils.ts#L1104-L1111<br>[2]https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/d29db16bfcf9a4be8febc3d19d52263e8c3d0055/packages/components/src/storageUtils.ts#L170-L175<br>[3]https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/d29db16bfcf9a4be8febc3d19d52263e8c3d0055/packages/components/src/storageUtils.ts#L533-L541<br>[4]https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/d29db16bfcf9a4be8febc3d19d52263e8c3d0055/packages/server/src/controllers/attachments/index.ts#L4-L11<br>[5]https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/d29db16bfcf9a4be8febc3d19d52263e8c3d0055/packages/server/src/routes/attachments/index.ts#L8<br>[6]https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/d29db16bfcf9a4be8febc3d19d52263e8c3d0055/packages/server/src/services/attachments/index.ts#L7-L16<br>[7]https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/d29db16bfcf9a4be8febc3d19d52263e8c3d0055/packages/server/src/utils/createAttachment.ts#L118-L126<br>[8]https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/blob/d29db16bfcf9a4be8febc3d19d52263e8c3d0055/packages/server/src/utils/index.ts#L1950-L1954<br>[9]https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/security/advisories/GHSA-35g6-rrw3-v6xc |

| 31 | CVE-2025-57247 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | The BATBToken smart contract (address 0xfbf1388408670c02f0dbbb74251d8ded1d63b7a2, Compiler Version v0.8.26+commit.8a97fa7a) contains incorrect access control implementation in whitelist management functions. The setColdWhiteList() and setSpecialAddress() functions in the base ERC20 contract are declared as public without proper access control modifiers, allowing any user to bypass transfer restrictions and manipulate special address settings. This enables unauthorized users to circumvent cold time transfer restrictions and potentially disrupt dividend distribution mechanisms, leading to privilege escalation and violation of the contract`s intended tokenomics. | [1]https://bscscan.com/address/0xfbf1388408670c02f0dbbb74251d8ded1d63b7a2#code<br>[2]https://github.com/RikkaLzw/CVE/blob/main/CVE_BATB-TOKEN.md |

| 42 | CVE-2025-61777 | 9.4  | CRITICAL | Flag Forge is a Capture The Flag (CTF) platform. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.3.2, the `/api/admin/badge-templates` (GET) and `/api/admin/badge-templates/create` (POST) endpoints previously allowed access without authentication or authorization. This could have enabled unauthorized users to retrieve all badge templates and sensitive metadata (createdBy, createdAt, updatedAt) and/or create arbitrary badge templates in the database. This could lead to data exposure, database pollution, or abuse of the badge system. The issue has been fixed in FlagForge v2.3.2. GET, POST, UPDATE, and DELETE endpoints now require authentication. Authorization checks ensure only admins can access and modify badge templates. No reliable workarounds are available. | [1]https://github.com/FlagForgeCTF/flagForge/commit/e2121c5fb7a512a49dcd875812c944265fb1a846<br>[2]https://github.com/FlagForgeCTF/flagForge/security/advisories/GHSA-26rx-c53q-rjf9 |
