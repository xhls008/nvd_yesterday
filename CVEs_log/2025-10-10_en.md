| 48 | CVE-2025-60004 | 7.5  | HIGH | An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-Of-Service (DoS).When an affected system receives a specific BGP EVPN update message over an established BGP session, this causes an rpd crash and restart.A BGP EVPN configuration is not necessary to be vulnerable. If peers are not configured to send BGP EVPN updates to a vulnerable device, then this issue can`t occur.This issue affects iBGP and eBGP, over IPv4 and IPv6.This issue affects:Junos OS:  *  23.4 versions from 23.4R2-S3 before 23.4R2-S5,  *  24.2 versions from 24.2R2 before 24.2R2-S1,  *  24.4 versions before 24.4R1-S3, 24.4R2;Junos OS Evolved:  *  23.4-EVO versions from 23.4R2-S2-EVO before 23.4R2-S5-EVO,  *  24.2-EVO versions from 24.2R2-EVO before 24.2R2-S1-EVO,  *  24.4-EVO versions before 24.4R1-S3-EVO, 24.4R2-EVO. | [1]https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA103165 |

| 50 | CVE-2025-55200 | 7.1  | HIGH | BigBlueButton is an open-source virtual classroom. In versions prior to 3.0.13, the "Shared Notes" feature contains a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability with the input location being the "Username" field and the output location on the "Shared Notes" page, when a user with a malicious username is editing content. This vulnerability allows a low-privileged user to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of higher-privileged users (e.g., Admins) who open the Shared Notes page.

| 51 | CVE-2025-59146 | 8.5  | HIGH | New API is a large language mode (LLM) gateway and artificial intelligence (AI) asset management system. An authenticated Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in versions prior to 0.9.0.5. A feature within the application allows authenticated users to submit a URL for the server to process its content. The application fails to properly validate this user-supplied URL before making a server-side request. This vulnerability is not limited to image URLs and can be triggered with any link provided to the vulnerable endpoint. Since user registration is often enabled by default, any registered user can exploit this. By crafting a malicious URL, an attacker can coerce the server to send requests to arbitrary internal or external services. The vulnerability has been patched in version 0.9.0.5. The patch introduces a comprehensive, user-configurable SSRF protection module, which is enabled by default to protect server security. This new feature provides administrators with granular control over outbound requests made by the server. For users who cannot upgrade immediately, some temporary mitigation options are available. Enable new-api image processing worker (new-api-worker) and/or configure egress firewall rules. | [1]https://github.com/QuantumNous/new-api/commit/ef634160986c6f6b087cbfe131074fda862928af<br>[2]https://github.com/QuantumNous/new-api/security/advisories/GHSA-xxv6-m6fx-vfhh |

| 66 | CVE-2025-61773 | 8.1  | HIGH | pyLoad is a free and open-source download manager written in Python. In versions prior to 0.5.0b3.dev91, pyLoad web interface contained insufficient input validation in both the Captcha script endpoint and the Click`N`Load (CNL) Blueprint. This flaw allowed untrusted user input to be processed unsafely, which could be exploited by an attacker to inject arbitrary content into the web UI or manipulate request handling. The vulnerability could lead to client-side code execution (XSS) or other unintended behaviors when a malicious payload is submitted. user-supplied parameters from HTTP requests were not adequately validated or sanitized before being passed into the application logic and response generation. This allowed crafted input to alter the expected execution flow. CNL (Click`N`Load) blueprint exposed unsafe handling of untrusted parameters in HTTP requests. The application did not consistently enforce input validation or encoding, making it possible for an attacker to craft malicious requests. Version 0.5.0b3.dev91 contains a patch for the issue. | [1]https://github.com/pyload/pyload/commit/5823327d0b797161c7195a1f660266d30a69f0ca<br>[2]https://github.com/pyload/pyload/pull/4624<br>[3]https://github.com/pyload/pyload/security/advisories/GHSA-cjjf-27cc-pvmv |
