| 14 | CVE-2025-24977 | 9.1  | CRITICAL | OpenCTI is an open cyber threat intelligence (CTI) platform. Prior to version 6.4.11 any user with the capability `manage customizations` can execute commands on the underlying infrastructure where OpenCTI is hosted and can access internal server side secrets by misusing the web-hooks. Since the malicious user gets a root shell inside a container this opens up the the infrastructure environment for further attacks and exposures. Version 6.4.11 fixes the issue. | [1]https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/security/advisories/GHSA-mf88-g2wq-p7qm |

| 16 | CVE-2025-46340 | 7.2  | HIGH | Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.0.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, due to an oversight in the validation performed in `UrlPreviewService` and `MkUrlPreview`, it is possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary CSS into the `MkUrlPreview` component. `UrlPreviewService.wrap` falls back to returning the original URL if it`s using a protocol that is likely to not be understood by Misskey, IE something other than `http` or `https`. This both can de-anonymize users and_allow further attacks in the client. Additionally, `MkUrlPreview` doesn`t escape CSS when applying a `background-image` property, allowing an attacker to craft a URL that applies arbitrary styles to the preview element. Theoretically, an attacker can craft a CSS injection payload to create a fake error message that can deceive the user into giving away their credentials or similar sensitive information. Version 2025.4.1 contains a patch for the issue. | [1]https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/commit/d10fdfe9738b17a9d81037c031b40a2cc4cb8038<br>[2]https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-3p2w-xmv5-jm95 |
